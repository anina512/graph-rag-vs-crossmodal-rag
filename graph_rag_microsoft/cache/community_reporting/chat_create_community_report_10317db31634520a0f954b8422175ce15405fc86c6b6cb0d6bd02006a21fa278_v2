This is supported by the description \"\"Champagne is a type of sparkling wine used in the French 75 cocktail.\"\" This description provides a clear and specific definition of \"\"Champagne\"\" in this context.\n\nThe second description, \"\"Champagne is an ingredient in the Saint-Florent Cocktail,\"\" further supports the idea that \"\"Champagne\"\" refers to a type of wine. However, the first description, \"\"Champagne is a type of person who might enjoy the French 75 cocktail,\"\" appears to be a more figurative or colloquial use of the term.
