It is primarily a container used for baking, cooking, and serving food. A pan is a type of kitchenware that serves as a kitchen vessel for baking and cooking. It is often used in recipes such as the Lemon Coconut Mousse, where it is used to heat egg yolks, and in the Roast Chicken recipe, where it is used to cook the chicken.\n\nPans are commonly used for roasting and sautéing, and they can be used to melt butter or heat oil for frying dough balls. They are also used to hold fish packages while cooking and to shape dough into a loaf. In addition, pans are used to roast poussins and to shape the loaf during baking.\n\nIn terms of functionality, pans are cooking vessels that can be used for a variety of tasks, including draining, melting butter, and cooking food. They are essential equipment in baking and are used to shape and hold food during the cooking process.\n\nOverall, the pan is a multifaceted kitchen tool that plays a crucial role in cooking and baking. Its versatility and functionality make it an essential item in any kitchen.\",13\r\n690,BATTER,\"The entity in question is \"\"BATTER.\"\" Based on the provided descriptions, a comprehensive summary can be generated.\n\nBatter is a mixture of ingredients used in various culinary contexts, primarily for cooking and baking. It is a fundamental component in many recipes, serving as a base for a wide range of dishes. The mixture typically consists of a combination of ingredients, which may include flour, liquid, and other additives, depending on the specific application.\n\nIn cooking, batter is often used to create crispy, golden-brown coatings for foods such as fried chicken, fish, and vegetables. It can also be used as a binding agent to hold ingredients together, as seen in dishes like meatballs and burgers.\n\nIn baking, batter is used to create a variety of sweet and savory treats, including pancakes, waffles, and cakes. The mixture is often leavened with yeast or baking powder to produce a light and airy texture.\n\nOverall, batter is a versatile mixture of ingredients that plays a crucial role in many different types of cooking and baking. Its adaptability and functionality make it a staple in many kitchens around the world.\n\nNote: The contradictions in the original descriptions have been resolved by recognizing that batter is indeed used in both cooking and baking, and that the mixture of ingredients is a common thread throughout these various applications.\",4\r\n2866,RAK,The rack is a kitchen utensil used for cooling,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n36,PLASTIC WRAP,DOUGH,\"The entity \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" is a type of material used in various applications, including baking. It is often used in conjunction with \"\"DOUGH,\"\" a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used to create baked goods.\n\nIn the context of baking, \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" is primarily used to cover \"\"DOUGH\"\" to prevent it from drying out or coming into contact with air, which can cause it to rise unevenly or develop an unpleasant texture. This is a common practice in many baking recipes, as it helps to maintain the dough's moisture and allows it to develop the desired consistency.\n\nBy covering the \"\"DOUGH\"\" with \"\"PLASTIC WRAP,\"\" bakers can ensure that their baked goods turn out light, fluffy, and with a tender crumb. This is particularly important when working with yeast-based doughs, as the yeast needs a warm, humid environment to activate and produce carbon dioxide, causing the dough to rise.\n\nIn addition to preventing drying out, \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" can also be used to help \"\"DOUGH\"\" relax and become easier to work with. When dough is overworked or subjected to too much stress, it can become tough and dense. By covering it with \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" and allowing it to rest, the gluten in the dough can relax, making it easier to shape and roll out.\n\nOverall, the use of \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" in conjunction with \"\"DOUGH\"\" is a common practice in baking that helps to ensure the production of high-quality, delicious baked goods. By understanding the role of \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" in the baking process, bakers can achieve better results and create a wide range of tasty treats.\",61\r\n539,PAN,WORK SURFACE,The cookie layer was placed on the work surface,23\r\n135,BATTER,PAN,Batter is poured into a pan,17\r\n829,PAN,RAK,The pan is placed on the rack to cool,14\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
