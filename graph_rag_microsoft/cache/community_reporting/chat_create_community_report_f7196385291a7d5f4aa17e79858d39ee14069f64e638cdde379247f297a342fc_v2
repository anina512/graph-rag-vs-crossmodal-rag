It is primarily known for being a sweet treat used to decorate cookies, adding a fun and playful touch to baked goods. However, its composition is more complex, consisting of sugar, gelatin, and air. This combination of ingredients gives the MARSHMALLOW its characteristic light and fluffy texture.\n\nThe MARSHMALLOW's use in decorating cookies is a popular tradition, often associated with festive occasions and celebrations. Its sweet and airy nature makes it an ideal addition to various baked goods, including cakes, cupcakes, and other sweet treats.\n\nDespite its versatility, the MARSHMALLOW's composition is rooted in its basic ingredients. The presence of sugar provides sweetness, while gelatin acts as a gelling agent, giving the MARSHMALLOW its shape and structure.
