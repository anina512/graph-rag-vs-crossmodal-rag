It is a type of sweetener made from the nectar of flowers, which is collected and processed by bees into a thick, syrupy liquid. Honey is a key ingredient in various recipes, including Chocolate-Hazelnut Cookies, Silky Peanut Butter Dressing, Extreme Granola, and many others. It is used to add flavor, sweetness, and moisture to a wide range of baked goods, desserts, and savory dishes.\n\nHoney is a versatile ingredient that can be used in both baking and cooking. It is a popular choice for sweetening dressings, marinades, and glazes, and is often used to coat fried dough balls, struffoli, and other sweet treats. In addition to its culinary uses, honey is also valued for its medicinal and therapeutic properties.\n\nIn terms of its production, honey is made by bees as they collect nectar from flowers and transform it into a sweet, viscous fluid through a process of regurgitation and evaporation. This process involves the bees storing the nectar in their honey stomach, where it is mixed with enzymes that break down the complex sugars into simpler ones. The nectar is then regurgitated and evaporated to create the thick, syrupy liquid that we know as honey.\n\nOverall, honey is a unique and valuable ingredient that has been prized for its sweetness, nutritional value, and medicinal properties for thousands of years. Its versatility and wide range of uses make it a staple in many cuisines around the world, and its production by bees is a testament to the incredible complexity and sophistication of these incredible insects.\",15\r\n6255,TERIYAKI SAUCE,Teriyaki sauce is a type of sauce used in cooking,1\r\n7148,HONEY-ROASTED ONION TART,A recipe for a sweet and savory tart made with honey-roasted onions and bacon,3\r\n1750,PUFF PASTRY,Puff pastry is used in Tarte Tatin,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3559,HONEY,SAMBAL OLEK,Sambal Oelek and Honey are both ingredients in Sambal Shrimp Lettuce Wraps,17\r\n2404,TERIYAKI SAUCE,HONEY,Teriyaki sauce and honey are used together in the recipe,16\r\n2902,HONEY-ROASTED ONION TART,PUFF PASTRY,The recipe uses puff pastry as a main ingredient,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
