It is primarily made from the juices of meat, particularly from roasted animals such as turkeys. However, the process of creating gravy is not limited to using only the juices of a single roasted animal. Instead, it often involves combining the pan juices with a gravy base, which is a mixture of ingredients designed to enhance the flavor and texture of the sauce.\n\nIn its most basic form, gravy is a sauce served with food to add moisture, flavor, and richness to the dish. This can be achieved by using the juices of roasted meat, which are then mixed with a gravy base to create a smooth and savory sauce. The gravy base typically consists of a combination of ingredients such as flour, butter, or other seasonings that are designed to thicken and flavor the sauce.\n\nThe use of gravy as a sauce dates back to ancient times, where it was used to serve with roasted meats. Over time, the recipe for gravy has evolved, and it is now commonly used in a variety of cuisines around the world. Whether it is served with a roasted turkey, a beef roast, or other types of meat, gravy remains a popular condiment that adds flavor and moisture to a dish.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"\"GRAVY\"\" is a type of sauce made from the juices of meat, particularly from roasted animals, and is often combined with a gravy base to create a smooth and savory sauce.
