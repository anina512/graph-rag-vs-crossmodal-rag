SCROOGE is a character in the story who is desperate in his curiosity and is familiar with the ghost in a white waistcoat. He is visited by Marley's Ghost, which sets off a series of strange events that SCROOGE experiences.\n\nAs a miserly businessman, SCROOGE is not approached by people in the street, and he is not asked for directions. This suggests that he is a man who is not well-liked or respected by his community. However, despite his miserly nature, SCROOGE is visited by the Spirit, who takes him on a journey through time to show him the error of his ways.\n\nDuring this journey, SCROOGE is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. These spirits show him the consequences of his actions and the impact they have on those around him. SCROOGE is a person who is observing the group with disgust and detestation, but through his experiences, he begins to see the error of his ways and undergoes a transformation.\n\nThroughout the story, SCROOGE is portrayed as a complex and multifaceted character. He is a person who is visited by a ghost, and his experiences with the spirits have a profound impact on his life.
