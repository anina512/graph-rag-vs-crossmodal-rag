Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n329,GLAZE,\"The entity \"\"GLAZE\"\" encompasses a wide range of definitions, but a comprehensive description can be formed by analyzing the provided descriptions.\n\nA glaze is a type of sweet, syrupy liquid used to top baked goods, such as cakes, pastries, and cookies. It is typically made from a mixture of sugar, corn syrup, and eggs, which are whisked well until a shiny, thick liquid is formed. This liquid can be poured over the cookies to coat them or spread over the cookies using an offset spatula or a smooth table knife.\n\nIn some cases, a glaze can be used as a topping for specific baked goods, such as apple cake, made from confectioners sugar, lemon juice, and water. Alternatively, a glaze can be used to add flavor to chicken, made from oil, garlic, and annatto seeds.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the initial description of a glaze being used to top crullers and beignets is not directly related to the other descriptions, as crullers and beignets are typically deep-fried dough pastries, and a glaze would not be a typical topping for them.\n\nIn terms of the chocolate glaze, it is described as a mixture of chocolate and butter that is melted and then cooled until room temperature. This type of glaze is sweet and sticky, made with chocolate and cream, and can be used as a topping for various baked goods.\n\nIn resolving the contradictions, it's clear that a glaze can be a sweet, syrupy liquid used to top baked goods, or it can be a type of sauce used to add flavor to chicken. The key is to understand the context in which the glaze is being used, and the ingredients that are being combined to create it.\n\nIn summary, a glaze is a versatile topping or sauce that can be used in a variety of ways, from adding flavor to chicken to topping baked goods like cakes, pastries, and cookies. It can be made from a range of ingredients, including sugar, corn syrup, eggs, chocolate, and cream, and is often whisked well until a shiny, thick liquid is formed.\",12\r\n814,RAW SUGAR,\"The entity in question is \"\"RAW SUGAR.\"\" Based on the provided descriptions, it appears that raw sugar is a versatile ingredient used in various recipes. \n\nRaw sugar is primarily used in sweet dishes, as evident from its inclusion in the Summer-Fruit Cobbler recipe. This suggests that raw sugar adds a distinct flavor and texture to baked goods, particularly those with a fruity twist.\n\nHowever, the descriptions also indicate that raw sugar is not a mandatory ingredient in all recipes. In the Strawberry Balsamic Shortcakes recipe, it is listed as an optional ingredient, implying that other sweeteners or flavorings can be used as substitutes.\n\nFurthermore, the Strawberry-Granola Crisp recipe also utilizes raw sugar, reinforcing its role as a key ingredient in sweet and crunchy desserts. This suggests that raw sugar is particularly well-suited for recipes that require a balance of sweetness and texture.\n\nIn resolving any potential contradictions, it is clear that raw sugar is a valuable ingredient in various sweet recipes, particularly those with a fruity or crunchy twist. While it may not be essential in every recipe, its inclusion can add depth and complexity to the final product.\n\nIn summary, raw sugar is a type of sugar used in a variety of sweet recipes, including the Summer-Fruit Cobbler, Strawberry Balsamic Shortcakes, and Strawberry-Granola Crisp. Its optional inclusion in the Strawberry Balsamic Shortcakes recipe suggests that it can be substituted with other sweeteners or flavorings, but its presence is often desirable in sweet and crunchy desserts.\",3\r\n2441,MERINGUES,Meringues is a component of the Spiced Praline Meringues recipe,2\r\n8210,HOT PEPPER JELLY,A type of condiment used in the glaze,1\r\n2014,MOUSSE,\"The entity \"\"MOUSSE\"\" is a type of dessert used in various recipes. It is a type of food that is commonly used in culinary preparations, particularly in sweet dishes. \n\nIn its most basic form, MOUSSE is a light and airy dessert made from a mixture of ingredients such as chocolate, cream, and sugar. It is often used as a topping or a filling for cakes, pastries, and other sweet treats. The texture of MOUSSE is typically smooth and creamy, making it a popular choice for those with a sweet tooth.\n\nMOUSSE can be made with a variety of flavors, including chocolate, vanilla, and fruit. It is often served chilled, which helps to enhance its texture and flavor. The dessert is also known for its versatility, as it can be used as a base for other desserts or as a topping for fruit or other sweet treats.\n\nIn addition to its use in desserts, MOUSSE is also used in some savory dishes, particularly in French cuisine. However, its most common use is in sweet dishes, where it adds a light and airy texture to the overall flavor and presentation of the dessert.\n\nOverall, MOUSSE is a popular dessert that is used in a variety of recipes and is known for its smooth and creamy texture, as well as its versatility in terms of flavor and presentation.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2521,GLAZE,COOKIES,Glaze is applied to cookies in this recipe,29\r\n2526,RAW SUGAR,COOKIES,Raw sugar is sprinkled on top of cookies in this recipe,20\r\n1850,MERINGUES,GLAZE,The meringues were topped with the glaze,14\r\n3477,HOT PEPPER JELLY,GLAZE,Hot pepper jelly is a key ingredient in the glaze,13\r\n1851,MERINGUES,MOUSSE,The meringues were used to make the mousse,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
