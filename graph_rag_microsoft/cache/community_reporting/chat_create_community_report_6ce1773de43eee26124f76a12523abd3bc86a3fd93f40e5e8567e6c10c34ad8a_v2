Wonton wrappers are typically made from a thin dough wrapper, usually made from wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs. They are often used as a wrapping material for a variety of fillings, such as meat, vegetables, or seafood, and are then steamed or pan-fried.\n\nWhile some sources may suggest that Wonton Wrappers are being fried, it is more accurate to say that they are often pan-fried after being filled and steamed. This cooking method allows the wrapper to become crispy on the outside while maintaining a delicate texture on the inside. The pan-frying process also enhances the flavor of the wrapper, making it a crucial step in preparing Wonton Wrappers.\n\nIn addition to their use as a wrapping material, Wonton Wrappers can also be used as a snack on their own.

It is often served on the side, allowing individuals to add it to their meals as desired.\n\nTaking this into account, a more accurate description of \"\"CHILI PASTE\"\" would be: \"\"CHILI PASTE is a type of condiment commonly used in Asian cuisine to add heat and flavor to various dishes.
