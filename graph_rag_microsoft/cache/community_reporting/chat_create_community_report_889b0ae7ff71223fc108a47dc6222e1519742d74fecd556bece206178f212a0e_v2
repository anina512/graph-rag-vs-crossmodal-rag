This liquid is a result of the cooking process, where the heat and moisture from the roast are released into the pan. The description of pan juices being left over from cooking a roast is consistent with this understanding, as it implies that the liquid is a residual product of the cooking process.\n\nHowever, the third description mentions that pan juices are reduced and served with pork. This description suggests that pan juices can be used as a sauce or a condiment to accompany pork dishes. This information can be incorporated into the summary, indicating that pan juices have a dual purpose: they can be used as a leftover liquid from cooking a roast, and they can also be reduced and served as a sauce to accompany other dishes, such as pork.\n\nIn resolving any potential contradictions, it is clear that the primary function of pan juices is as a leftover liquid from cooking a roast.
