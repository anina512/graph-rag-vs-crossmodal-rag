To resolve this ambiguity, it can be inferred that the time it takes to refrigerate the tartlet is likely a shorter period than 1 day, as the description does not contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, a comprehensive description of the entity \"\"1 DAY\"\" can be written as follows:\n\nThe entity \"\"1 DAY\"\" refers to a 24-hour period. In the context of food storage, \"\"1 day\"\" is the maximum time the shrimp salad can be chilled. This duration allows for safe storage and preservation of the salad. The time it takes to refrigerate the tartlet is a shorter period, likely a few hours, and is not specified in the provided descriptions.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n305,DOUGH,APPLES,The dough is used to hold the apples during baking,64\r\n1916,ROOM TEMPERATURE,DOUGH,Room temperature is a condition for rolling out dough,61\r\n2078,ROLLING PIN,DOUGH,A rolling pin is used to roll out dough,53\r\n677,DOUGH,LEFT HAND,The left hand cranks the machine with the dough,52\r\n1115,BENCH SCRAPER,DOUGH,A bench scraper is used to scrape dough off a surface,52\r\n2831,BAGELS,DOUGH,Bagels are made from dough,52\r\n614,PIE PLATE,DOUGH,A pie plate is used to hold a pie made from dough,51\r\n675,DOUGH,INDEX FINGERS,The dough is handled by the index fingers to prevent it from stretching and warping,51\r\n1472,PASTRY ROLLER,DOUGH,A pastry roller is used to roll out dough,51\r\n2073,DOUGH,COUNTER,The dough is rolled and shaped on the counter,51\r\n2629,DOUGH,GNOCCHI,Dough is used to make gnocchi,51\r\n3329,DOUGH,SURFACE,Dough is rolled out on a surface,51\r\n3429,HAND,DOUGH,Hand is used to press the dough into the pan,51\r\n3527,DOUGH,BAKING PANS,Dough is baked in the baking pans,51\r\n3772,DOUGH,BISCUIT CUTTER,\"The biscuit cutter is used to cut out the scones from the dough\nThe dough is cut into scones using the biscuit cutter\",51\r\n541,WORK SURFACE,COOKIE,The cookie layer was placed on the work surface,22\r\n3299,FREEZER,BREAD,Freezer is used to store bread,21\r\n3630,APPLE CAKE,SPRINGFORM PAN,The apple cake is baked in a springform pan,14\r\n1339,SHRIMP SALAD,ROOM TEMPERATURE,Shrimp salad should be brought to room temperature before serving,13\r\n3562,TART PAN,CRUST,A tart pan is used to bake a crust,11\r\n1533,INGREDIENTS,DARK CHOCOLATE PRETZEL CAKE,The ingredients are needed to make the cake,6\r\n681,CHITARRA,ROLLING PIN,The chitarra is pressed onto by the rolling pin,5\r\n680,RIGHT HAND,LEFT HAND,The right hand feeds the machine and the left hand cranks it,4\r\n1534,INSTRUCTIONS,DARK CHOCOLATE PRETZEL CAKE,The instructions are needed to make the cake,4\r\n2832,BAGELS,SHEET PAN,Bagels are baked on a sheet pan,4\r\n3632,APPLE CAKE,APPLE MIXTURE,The apple cake has an apple mixture as a filling,4\r\n1114,SQUARE,BENCH SCRAPER,A square is a shape that can be scraped with a bench scraper,3\r\n1340,SHRIMP SALAD,1 DAY,Shrimp salad can be chilled for up to 1 day,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
