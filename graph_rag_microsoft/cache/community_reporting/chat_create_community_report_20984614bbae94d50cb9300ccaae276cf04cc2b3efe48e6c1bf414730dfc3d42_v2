Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n645,GIN,\"The entity \"\"GIN\"\" encompasses a multifaceted concept that can be understood in different contexts. \n\nIn the realm of mixology, Gin is a type of spirit used as a primary ingredient in various cocktails, including the French 75 and the Saint-Florent Cocktail. The French 75, a classic cocktail, typically consists of Gin, lemon juice, sugar, and champagne, while the Saint-Florent Cocktail, another notable mix, incorporates Gin as one of its key components.\n\nHowever, when considering the term \"\"Gin\"\" in a broader sense, it can also refer to a type of person who might appreciate the French 75 cocktail. This interpretation suggests that the name \"\"Gin\"\" is associated with an individual who enjoys sophisticated and refined beverages, often characteristic of those who appreciate fine mixology.\n\nTo reconcile these seemingly disparate definitions, it is essential to recognize that the term \"\"Gin\"\" can be applied to both the spirit and the person. In this context, the name \"\"Gin\"\" serves as a metaphor for someone who values the art of mixology and the culture surrounding it. This individual, much like the spirit, is refined, sophisticated, and perhaps a bit eccentric.\n\nIn conclusion, the entity \"\"GIN\"\" encompasses a complex and multifaceted concept that can be understood in various contexts. As a spirit, Gin is a key ingredient in numerous cocktails, while as a person, it represents someone who appreciates the art of mixology and the culture surrounding it.\",5\r\n8912,PINEAPPLE AND GIN,Pineapple and Gin is a cocktail recipe,6\r\n644,FRENCH 75,\"French 75 is a cocktail made with gin, lemon juice, sugar, and Champagne\",4\r\n1209,TONIC WATER,Tonic water is an ingredient in the sorbetto,2\r\n646,CHAMPAGNE,\"The entity \"\"CHAMPAGNE\"\" can be described as a type of sparkling wine. This conclusion is derived from the provided descriptions, which initially appear to be contradictory. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the term \"\"Champagne\"\" is being used to refer to both a type of person and a type of wine.\n\nIn the context of the French 75 cocktail, \"\"Champagne\"\" is indeed a type of sparkling wine used as an ingredient. This is supported by the description \"\"Champagne is a type of sparkling wine used in the French 75 cocktail.\"\" This description provides a clear and specific definition of \"\"Champagne\"\" in this context.\n\nThe second description, \"\"Champagne is an ingredient in the Saint-Florent Cocktail,\"\" further supports the idea that \"\"Champagne\"\" refers to a type of wine. However, the first description, \"\"Champagne is a type of person who might enjoy the French 75 cocktail,\"\" appears to be a more figurative or colloquial use of the term. In this context, \"\"Champagne\"\" is being used to describe a type of person who might appreciate the French 75 cocktail, rather than a type of wine.\n\nTaking all of these descriptions into account, it can be concluded that the entity \"\"CHAMPAGNE\"\" is primarily a type of sparkling wine used in various cocktails, including the French 75 and the Saint-Florent Cocktail. While the term may be used in a more figurative sense to describe a type of person, this usage is secondary to its primary meaning as a type of wine.\",1\r\n647,COLIN FIELD,Colin Field is a person who suggested serving the French 75 cocktail over ice in a tumbler,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n262,GIN,LEMON,Gin and lemon are mixed together in the sorbetto recipe,68\r\n3872,PINEAPPLE AND GIN,PINEAPPLE,Pineapple is a main ingredient in the Pineapple and Gin cocktail,12\r\n125,FRENCH 75,GIN,Gin is a key ingredient in the French 75 cocktail,9\r\n261,TONIC WATER,GIN,Tonic water and gin are mixed together in the sorbetto recipe,7\r\n127,FRENCH 75,CHAMPAGNE,Champagne is a key ingredient in the French 75 cocktail,5\r\n128,FRENCH 75,COLIN FIELD,Colin Field suggested serving the French 75 cocktail over ice in a tumbler,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
