It is often used in conjunction with \"\"DOUGH,\"\" a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used to create baked goods.\n\nIn the context of baking, \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" is primarily used to cover \"\"DOUGH\"\" to prevent it from drying out or coming into contact with air, which can cause it to rise unevenly or develop an unpleasant texture. This is a common practice in many baking recipes, as it helps to maintain the dough's moisture and allows it to develop the desired consistency.\n\nBy covering the \"\"DOUGH\"\" with \"\"PLASTIC WRAP,\"\" bakers can ensure that their baked goods turn out light, fluffy, and with a tender crumb. This is particularly important when working with yeast-based doughs, as the yeast needs a warm, humid environment to activate and produce carbon dioxide, causing the dough to rise.\n\nIn addition to preventing drying out, \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" can also be used to help \"\"DOUGH\"\" relax and become easier to work with. When dough is overworked or subjected to too much stress, it can become tough and dense. By covering it with \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" and allowing it to rest, the gluten in the dough can relax, making it easier to shape and roll out.\n\nOverall, the use of \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" in conjunction with \"\"DOUGH\"\" is a common practice in baking that helps to ensure the production of high-quality, delicious baked goods. By understanding the role of \"\"PLASTIC WRAP\"\" in the baking process, bakers can achieve better results and create a wide range of tasty treats.\",61\r\n321,WIRE RACK,PIE,The pie is cooled on a wire rack,38\r\n1057,ROAST,SAUCE,Roast is served with the sauce,35\r\n870,GANACHE,CHOCOLATE,The ganache is a mixture of chocolate and cream,34\r\n2521,GLAZE,COOKIES,Glaze is applied to cookies in this recipe,29\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
