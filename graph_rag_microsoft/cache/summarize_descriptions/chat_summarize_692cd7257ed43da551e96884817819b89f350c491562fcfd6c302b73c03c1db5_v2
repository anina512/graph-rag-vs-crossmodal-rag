It is a location where baking takes place, and people bake cakes within its city limits. Cashion is a significant location mentioned in various recipes, including the Amalfi Calamari Pasta and the Berry and Ricotta Slice. However, it is essential to note that Cashion is a fictional location, but it is often referred to as the capital city of Aurelia.\n\nIn some contexts, Cashion is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it is implied to be the capital city of Aurelia. In such cases, it is reasonable to assume that Cashion is the capital city of Aurelia, as stated in some descriptions. Therefore, the most accurate and coherent description of Cashion is that it is the capital city of Aurelia, where baking takes place, and it is a significant location mentioned in various recipes.\n\nIt is worth noting that some descriptions may seem contradictory, but after resolving the inconsistencies, it is clear that Cashion is a city in Aurelia, serving as the capital city, and it is a location where baking occurs.
