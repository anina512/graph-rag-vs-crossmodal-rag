However, this description is not universally applicable, as cakes can have different structures and compositions.\n\nIn the context of a frittata, the CENTER is a location where the eggs are set, indicating that the frittata is cooked. This description is consistent with the idea that the CENTER of a frittata is a location where the eggs are set, as opposed to the edges, which may still be runny.\n\nIn the context of pudding, the CENTER is checked with a wooden skewer to determine if it is cooked. This description is consistent with the idea that the CENTER of a pudding is a location where its texture and composition can be evaluated.\n\nIn the context of brownies, the CENTER is a location where the brownies are checked to see if they are done baking. This description is consistent with the idea that the CENTER of a brownie is a location where its texture and composition can be evaluated.\n\nIn summary, the CENTER, in various culinary contexts, refers to a specific location where the texture and composition of a dish can be evaluated. This location is often used to check if a dish is cooked, and it can be a location where the eggs are set in a frittata, or where a wooden skewer is inserted to check the texture of a pudding.
