It is a versatile kitchen tool that can be used for a wide range of cooking techniques, including sautéing, roasting, baking, and deep-frying.\n\nA skillet is typically used over medium to high heat, as seen in the use of a large skillet over medium-high heat to cook chorizo, and another instance where 1 tablespoon of oil is heated in a large skillet over medium heat. This suggests that skillets are often used for high-heat cooking methods, such as searing and browning.\n\nIn addition to high-heat cooking, skillets can also be used for low-heat cooking methods, such as baking and roasting. For example, a skillet is used to bake a cake, and another instance where a skillet is used to roast plums. This versatility makes skillets a valuable addition to any kitchen.\n\nSkillets are also used in various recipes, including Skillet Stuffing, Mexican Fiesta Casserole, and Matzoh Vegetable Stuffing. In these recipes, the skillet is used to cook the ingredients, such as sautéing vegetables in Mushroom Barley Risotto and sautéing onion and other ingredients in the recipe for Matzoh Vegetable Stuffing.\n\nFurthermore, skillets can be used to cook a variety of foods, including meats, vegetables, and even desserts. For example, a skillet is used to cook bacon and steak, and another instance where a skillet is used to cook sole fillets. This suggests that skillets are a versatile cooking tool that can be used for a wide range of dishes.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"SKILLET\" is a type of cooking vessel that is used in various recipes and cooking methods.
