It is a type of food that is typically consumed for its flavor and texture.\n\nHowever, another description suggests that CAKE needs to be brushed with egg yolks and water. This step is often associated with the preparation of certain types of CAKE, particularly those that require a specific glaze or topping. It is essential to note that not all CAKE types require this step, and it may be more relevant to specific recipes or cooking methods.\n\nTo resolve the potential contradiction, it is essential to understand that the description of CAKE as a \"sweet baked dessert\" is a general characteristic, while the need to brush CAKE with egg yolks and water is a specific preparation method. These two descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and CAKE can indeed be a sweet baked dessert that requires a specific preparation method, such as brushing with egg yolks and water, depending on the recipe or type of CAKE.\n\nIn conclusion, CAKE is a sweet baked dessert that can be prepared in various ways, including brushing with egg yolks and water, depending on the specific recipe or cooking method.
