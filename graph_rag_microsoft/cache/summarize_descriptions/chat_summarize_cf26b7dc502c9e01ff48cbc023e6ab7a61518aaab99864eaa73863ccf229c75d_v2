In a biological context, they are used for various essential functions, including eating. This highlights the importance of hands in facilitating basic human needs, such as consuming food and drinks.\n\nHowever, the descriptions also suggest that hands can be used in a more specialized context, particularly in baking and cooking. The mention of hands being used to mix the marinade indicates their role in preparing food, which is a common activity in culinary practices. Furthermore, the description of hands as a type of equipment used in baking implies that they can be utilized as a tool in the baking process.\n\nTo reconcile the apparent contradiction between hands being a part of the human body and a type of equipment, it can be inferred that the latter description is likely referring to the use of hands as a tool or an instrument in a specific context, such as baking. In this sense, hands are being used as a means to achieve a particular goal, rather than being a separate entity from the human body.\n\nIn conclusion, hands are a vital part of the human body, used for various essential functions, including eating. They can also be used as a tool or instrument in specific contexts, such as baking and cooking, to facilitate the preparation of food.
