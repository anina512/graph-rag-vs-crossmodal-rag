It involves making necessary changes or modifications to achieve a desired outcome. In the context of a mixture, adjusting is essential to prevent it from boiling too vigorously.\n\nTo prevent the mixture from boiling too vigorously, adjusting the heat is necessary. This implies that the heat level needs to be controlled or modified to maintain a stable and safe boiling process. The goal of adjusting in this context is to ensure that the mixture boils at a moderate pace, allowing for efficient and controlled heating.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"ADJUST\" is a process that involves making necessary changes or modifications to achieve a desired outcome.
