This description suggests that edges are utilized in multiple contexts, possibly including but not limited to, design, architecture, or even digital applications.\n\nHowever, another description states that \"The edge of the pan is used to add oil.\" This description implies that an edge can also refer to the border or rim of a physical object, such as a cooking pan. In this context, the edge serves a functional purpose, allowing users to add substances like oil.\n\nTo resolve the potential contradiction between these two descriptions, it can be inferred that the term \"edge\" has a broad range of meanings and applications. In one sense, an edge can be a general concept referring to a boundary or border in various contexts. In another sense, an edge can specifically refer to the border or rim of a physical object, such as a pan.\n\nTaking both descriptions into account, a comprehensive summary of the entity \"EDGE\" can be generated. An edge is a versatile concept that can refer to a boundary or border in various applications, including design, architecture, and digital contexts. Additionally, an edge can also refer to the border or rim of a physical object, such as a cooking pan, where it serves a functional purpose.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"EDGE\" encompasses multiple meanings and applications, ranging from abstract boundaries to physical borders.
