This indicates that it is a quantitative value that represents the thermal state of the turkey's interior. \n\nIt is also used to determine the doneness of the turkey. This implies that the internal temperature serves as an indicator of the turkey's level of cooking, with certain temperature thresholds signifying that the turkey is cooked to a safe and edible state.\n\nConsidering these two descriptions together, it can be concluded that internal temperature is a critical measurement used to assess the doneness and safety of a cooked turkey. It is a quantitative value that represents the thermal state of the turkey's interior, and its measurement is essential for ensuring that the turkey is cooked to a safe and edible state.\n\nIn summary, internal temperature is a measure of the temperature inside a turkey, used to determine the doneness of the turkey.
