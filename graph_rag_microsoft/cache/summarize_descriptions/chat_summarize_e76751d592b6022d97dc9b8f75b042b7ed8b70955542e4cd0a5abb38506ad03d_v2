They are a common ingredient in cocktails (Description 1), and their versatility extends to being a key ingredient in sweet dishes like the Cranberry-Maple Pudding Cake recipe (Description 2). \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the context of the descriptions is somewhat ambiguous, with one description suggesting that \"cranberries\" might refer to a company that produces cranberries (Description 3). In this case, the company would likely be a producer of the fruit, rather than the fruit itself. \n\nTo clarify, the primary focus of the descriptions is on the fruit, and it is reasonable to assume that the context is referring to the fruit, rather than a company. Therefore, the description will focus on the fruit.\n\nIn addition to their use in sweet and savory recipes, cranberries are also an ingredient used in various dishes, including Roast Pork Tenderloin (Description 5). They are a type of food ingredient that can be used in a wide range of culinary applications.\n\nIn summary, cranberries are a type of small, red fruit that is often used in various recipes, including sweet and savory dishes.
