It is a key ingredient in many recipes, including the Nasturtium Pizza, where it helps to leaven the dough. \n\nIn the context of bread-making, YEAST is a microorganism that consumes the added flour and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. This process of fermentation is essential in making bread rise, as the carbon dioxide gets trapped in the dough, causing it to expand. As a result, YEAST is a vital component in baking, used to make dough rise.\n\nYEAST is a type of microorganism that ferments sugars in bread-making, which is a critical step in the production of bread. Its ability to ferment sugars and produce carbon dioxide makes it an indispensable ingredient in baking. \n\nIn summary, YEAST is a microorganism used in baking to cause dough to rise, and it is a key ingredient in various recipes, including bread-making and pizza recipes. Its unique ability to ferment sugars and produce carbon dioxide makes it an essential component in the production of bread and other baked goods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763471332, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 326, "total_tokens": 562, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
