It is a type of cooking aid designed to elevate food above the cooking surface, allowing for air to circulate and promoting browning and crisping of the food's surface.\n\nBy using a Roasting Rack, cooks can achieve a more evenly cooked dish, as the air can circulate freely around the food, reducing the risk of overcooking or undercooking certain areas.
