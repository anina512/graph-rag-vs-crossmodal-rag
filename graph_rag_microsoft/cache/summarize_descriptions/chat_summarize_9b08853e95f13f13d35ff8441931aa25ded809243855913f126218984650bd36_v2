It is used to add moisture and flavor to dishes, making it an essential element in many recipes. In the context of cooking, liquid can refer to the moisture present in the pan, such as the moisture from mushrooms.\n\nHowever, the description \"Liquid evaporates and the meat starts to caramelize\" suggests that liquid can also be a component that is intentionally added to a dish and then evaporated to achieve a specific texture or flavor. This is consistent with the idea that liquid is used to add moisture and flavor to dishes.\n\nThe description \"The liquid in the casserole is strained and then boiled\" further supports the idea that liquid can be a component that is intentionally added to a dish and then processed to achieve a specific texture or flavor. This process of straining and boiling suggests that the liquid is being purified or clarified, which is consistent with the idea that liquid is used to add moisture and flavor to dishes.\n\nIn summary, liquid is a versatile component in cooking that can refer to the moisture present in the pan or a component that is intentionally added to a dish to add moisture and flavor. It can be used in various cooking processes, including the sofrito process, and can be processed through straining and boiling to achieve a specific texture or flavor.\n\nIt is worth noting that the descriptions provided do not appear to be contradictory, but rather complementary.
