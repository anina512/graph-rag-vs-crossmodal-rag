It refers to a single layer of the cake, which is typically created by dividing a single cake mixture into multiple portions and baking each portion separately. This process allows for the creation of distinct layers, each with its own unique texture and flavor profile.\n\nThe process of creating a cake layer often involves mixing together various ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, and butter to form a uniform batter. The batter is then poured into a cake pan and baked in an oven until it is cooked through and golden brown. Once the cake is baked, it is removed from the oven and allowed to cool before being cut into layers.\n\nThe act of cutting a cake into layers is a crucial step in the process of creating a multi-layered cake. This process involves using a serrated knife or a cake leveler to carefully cut through the cake, creating a smooth and even surface. The layers are then stacked on top of each other, often with a layer of frosting or filling in between, to create a visually appealing and delicious dessert.\n\nIn summary, the \"CAKE LAYER\" is a key component of a multi-layered cake, created by dividing a single cake mixture into multiple portions and baking each portion separately.
