It is often utilized to store food items, such as cookies, in a resealable manner. This ensures that the cookies remain fresh and protected from external contaminants. The resealable feature of the plastic bag also allows for easy access and re-closure, making it a practical choice for storing baked goods.\n\nHowever, the description of using a plastic bag to decorate a cake with glaze seems to be an unconventional use of the plastic bag. Upon closer examination, it appears that this description might be an error or a misinterpretation. Plastic bags are not typically used for decorating cakes, as they are not a suitable material for this purpose. Instead, they are usually used for packaging, storing, or carrying items.\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive summary of the plastic bag will focus on its primary uses, which include storing food items, such as cookies, in a resealable manner. This summary will exclude the potentially contradictory description of using a plastic bag to decorate a cake.\n\nIn conclusion, the plastic bag is a practical and convenient container used for storing food items, such as cookies, in a resealable manner.
