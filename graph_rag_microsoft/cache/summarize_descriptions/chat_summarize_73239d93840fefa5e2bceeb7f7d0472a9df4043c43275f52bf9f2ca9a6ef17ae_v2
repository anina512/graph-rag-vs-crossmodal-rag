It is not a type of baking powder, but rather a distinct ingredient used to help baked goods rise. BAKING SODA is a key component in many recipes, including those that require it to be used in the recipe itself.\n\nIn its role as a leavening agent, BAKING SODA works by releasing carbon dioxide gas when it comes into contact with liquid ingredients and heat. This reaction causes the dough or batter to rise, giving baked goods their light and airy texture. BAKING SODA is often used in conjunction with other leavening agents, such as baking powder, to achieve the desired level of rise.\n\nBAKING SODA has a number of other uses beyond baking. It can be used as a natural cleaner and odor absorber, and it is also used in various personal care products, such as toothpaste and mouthwash. Additionally, BAKING SODA can be used to neutralize acid and raise the pH of a solution.\n\nIn terms of its chemical composition, BAKING SODA is primarily composed of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). It is a white, crystalline powder that is highly soluble in water. BAKING SODA is also known for its distinctive alkaline taste and its ability to leave a residue on surfaces.\n\nOverall, BAKING SODA is a versatile and widely used ingredient with a range of applications in baking, cleaning, and personal care. Its unique properties make it an essential component in many recipes and products.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763471489, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 356, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
