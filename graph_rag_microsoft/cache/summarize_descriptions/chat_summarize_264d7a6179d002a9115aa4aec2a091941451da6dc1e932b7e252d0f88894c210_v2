This clarification is crucial in understanding its characteristics and uses. Clarified butter is butter that has been melted and had its milk solids removed, resulting in a clear, golden liquid with a nutty flavor and a higher smoke point than regular butter. This process makes ghee more suitable for high-heat cooking, such as sautéing and frying.\n\nTraditionally, ghee is used in Iranian cooking, where it is a staple ingredient. However, its use is not limited to Iranian cuisine. Ghee is also used in various other cooking traditions, including Indian and Middle Eastern cuisine. Its versatility and unique flavor profile make it a popular choice for many recipes.\n\nIn addition to its culinary uses, ghee is also an ingredient used in various recipes. This highlights its importance as a fundamental component in many dishes, particularly in traditional and cultural cooking.\n\nIn resolving any potential contradictions, it is clear that ghee is indeed a type of clarified butter, rather than a type of oil. While it can be used in cooking, its primary classification is as a clarified butter product. This distinction is essential in understanding its characteristics and uses.\n\nIn summary, Ghee is a type of clarified butter that is traditionally used in Iranian cooking, as well as in various other cuisines. Its unique flavor profile and high smoke point make it a popular choice for high-heat cooking, and it is a fundamental ingredient in many recipes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763472185, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 315, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 526, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
