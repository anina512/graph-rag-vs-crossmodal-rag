To enhance its flavor, the CHICKEN is typically brushed with a GLAZE. The GLAZE is a sweet and savory sauce that adds a rich, velvety texture to the CHICKEN.\n\nAccording to the available information, the CHICKEN is brushed with the GLAZE during the last 10 minutes of cooking. This suggests that the GLAZE is applied towards the end of the cooking process, allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat without overpowering it.\n\nThe application of the GLAZE to the CHICKEN is a deliberate culinary technique aimed at adding flavor and moisture to the meat. By brushing the GLAZE onto the CHICKEN during the last 10 minutes of cooking, the chef can ensure that the flavors are evenly distributed and the meat is cooked to perfection.\n\nIn summary, the CHICKEN is a culinary entity that benefits from the application of a GLAZE. The GLAZE is brushed onto the CHICKEN during the last 10 minutes of cooking, allowing the flavors to penetrate the meat and adding a rich, velvety texture to the dish.
