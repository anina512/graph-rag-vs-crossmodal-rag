According to the descriptions, the two entities are typically mixed together before being used in a recipe. Specifically, the descriptions state that \"Sugar and cinnamon are combined in a shallow bowl,\" indicating that the mixture is prepared in a specific manner. This suggests that the mixture is not simply a random combination of the two entities, but rather a deliberate blend of equal or complementary proportions.\n\nFurthermore, the descriptions also mention that \"The sugar and cinnamon are mixed together during baking.\" This implies that the mixture is not only prepared beforehand, but also that it is further incorporated into the baking process. This could suggest that the mixture is used as a topping or a seasoning for baked goods, or that it is an integral component of the recipe itself.\n\nConsidering the two descriptions together, it appears that the mixture of \"SUGAR\" and \"CINNAMON\" is a deliberate and intentional process that is closely tied to the baking process. The mixture is likely used to add flavor, texture, or visual appeal to baked goods, and is not simply a random combination of the two entities.\n\nIn summary, \"SUGAR\" and \"CINNAMON\" are often combined in a shallow bowl and mixed together during the baking process.
