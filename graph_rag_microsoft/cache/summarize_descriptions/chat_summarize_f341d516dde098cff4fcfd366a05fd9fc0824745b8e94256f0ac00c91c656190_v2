Based on the provided descriptions, it appears that \"2 hours\" is related to the process of cooling baked goods, specifically a cake and a tartlet.\n\nAfter analyzing the descriptions, it can be concluded that \"2 hours\" is the recommended cooling time for both the cake and the tartlet. This allows the baked goods to stand at room temperature, which is essential for their texture and flavor development.\n\nIn this context, \"2 hours\" is not a fixed time frame but rather a general guideline that may vary depending on the specific recipe, environmental conditions, and personal preferences. However, it serves as a standard reference point for ensuring that the baked goods are properly cooled before serving or storing.\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive description of the entity \"2 HOURS\" is as follows:\n\n\"2 hours is the recommended cooling time for baked goods, such as cakes and tartlets, allowing them to stand at room temperature and develop their texture and flavor.
