It involves placing a dish in a pan of water, typically to prevent the food from cracking or to achieve a specific texture. \n\nIn the context of the Mint Syrup, a water bath is used for sterilization purposes. This process involves submerging the Mint Syrup in a water bath to eliminate any bacteria or other microorganisms that may be present, thereby ensuring the syrup's safety for consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to baking the flan, a water bath is employed to prevent the dessert from cracking. This is because the water bath helps to regulate the temperature and reduce the risk of sudden temperature fluctuations, which can cause the flan to crack or break apart.\n\nIn general, the water bath cooking method is used to cook dishes in a controlled environment, where the water helps to distribute heat evenly and prevent overcooking. This method is particularly useful for delicate foods that require gentle heat and precise temperature control.\n\nOverall, the water bath is a valuable tool in the kitchen, offering a range of benefits and applications.
