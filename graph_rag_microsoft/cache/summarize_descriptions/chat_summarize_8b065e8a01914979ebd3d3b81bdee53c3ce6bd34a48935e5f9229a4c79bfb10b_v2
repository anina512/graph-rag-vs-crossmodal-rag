It is not a cooking appliance, but rather a specialized tool designed to facilitate the cooking process.\n\nA BAKING RACK is typically used to hold food, such as baked goods, at a distance from the heat source, allowing for even cooking and air circulation. This helps to promote browning and crisping of the food's surface, while preventing it from burning or becoming overcooked.\n\nIn terms of its design and functionality, a BAKING RACK is often constructed from durable materials, such as metal or silicone, and features multiple tiers or levels to accommodate a variety of food items. Some BAKING RACKS may also include additional features, such as adjustable height settings or non-stick coatings, to enhance their usability and ease of cleaning.\n\nOverall, the BAKING RACK is an essential tool for any home cook or professional chef, providing a convenient and efficient way to cook a wide range of dishes, from roasted vegetables to perfectly baked bread.
