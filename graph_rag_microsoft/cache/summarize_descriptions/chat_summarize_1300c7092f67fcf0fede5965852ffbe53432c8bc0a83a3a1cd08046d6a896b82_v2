Primarily, it serves as a tool for drying or cleaning surfaces. This is its most common and well-known function. Towels are typically made of absorbent materials, such as cotton or microfiber, which enable them to effectively soak up moisture and water.\n\nHowever, the second description suggests that a towel can also be used for purposes unrelated to drying or cleaning. In this context, a towel is used to set aside a cake. This description implies that the towel is being used as a makeshift surface or container to hold the cake temporarily.\n\nUpon closer examination, it appears that the second description is likely an error or a misinterpretation. In most cases, a towel would not be used to set aside a cake, as it would not provide a stable or suitable surface for the cake. Instead, a cake stand, plate, or other suitable container would be used for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive summary of the \"TOWEL\" entity will focus on its primary function.
