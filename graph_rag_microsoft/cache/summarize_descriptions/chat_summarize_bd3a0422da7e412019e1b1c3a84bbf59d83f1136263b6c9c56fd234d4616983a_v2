This suggests that its primary function is to prepare meals through the application of heat. However, one of the descriptions also mentions that the oven is used to keep the fried chicken warm. This implies that the oven can also be used for a secondary function, which is to maintain the temperature of already cooked food.\n\nConsidering both descriptions, it can be inferred that the oven is a versatile appliance that serves two main purposes: cooking food at high temperatures and keeping cooked food warm. This dual functionality makes the oven a valuable addition to any kitchen.\n\nIn summary, the \"OVEN\" is a kitchen appliance that is capable of cooking food at high temperatures and maintaining the temperature of already cooked food. Its primary function is to prepare meals through the application of heat, while its secondary function is to keep cooked food warm.
