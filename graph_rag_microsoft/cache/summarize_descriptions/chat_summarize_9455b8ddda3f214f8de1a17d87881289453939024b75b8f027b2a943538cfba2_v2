It is a tubular pasta shape, typically made from durum wheat semolina, and is characterized by its ridged surface. Rigatoni is a versatile pasta shape that can be paired with a wide range of sauces, from light and oily to rich and meat-based.\n\nOne of the most notable uses of Rigatoni is in the traditional Italian recipe, Pasta alla Gricia.

Its tubular shape and ridged surface make it an ideal pairing for hearty sauces, such as those made with meat ragù or vegetables. The pasta's texture also holds up well to robust flavors, making it a great choice for dishes featuring bold ingredients like mushrooms or truffles.\n\nOverall, Rigatoni is a beloved pasta shape that offers a unique combination of texture and versatility.
