It is commonly used in baking, particularly in the preparation of sweet treats such as Chocolate Macarons. The citrusy flavor and aroma of orange zest add a unique dimension to these delicate French meringue-based cookies.\n\nIn addition to its use in sweet dishes, orange zest is also employed in savory recipes, such as the marinade for Chili-Beef Skewers. The acidity and oil content in orange zest help to balance the bold flavors of the chili and beef, creating a harmonious and aromatic flavor profile.\n\nThe use of orange zest in both sweet and savory applications highlights its adaptability and ability to enhance a wide range of flavors. Whether used to add a burst of citrus flavor to baked goods or to add depth to a marinade, orange zest is a valuable ingredient in any kitchen.\n\nIt is worth noting that the use of orange zest in different recipes may vary depending on personal preference and the specific dish being prepared. However, its inclusion can often elevate the overall flavor and aroma of a dish, making it a valuable addition to any recipe.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763472334, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
