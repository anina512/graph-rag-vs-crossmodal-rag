In the context of a recipe, a step is a distinct and essential part of the overall process, often denoted by a numerical designation, such as \"Step 2\" or \"Step 1\".\n\nA step is typically a self-contained action that contributes to the final outcome of the recipe. It may involve a specific technique, ingredient, or sequence of events that must be executed in order to achieve the desired result. In the case of a recipe like the \"monkfish chowder\", a step might involve sautéing the onions, adding the fish, or seasoning the broth.\n\nIn essence, a step is a crucial building block of a recipe, and its successful execution is essential to the overall success of the dish. By breaking down a complex recipe into individual steps, cooks and chefs can ensure that each component is prepared correctly and that the final product meets their expectations.\n\nIn summary, a step is a single action or instruction that is part of a recipe, contributing to the overall process of preparing a dish.
