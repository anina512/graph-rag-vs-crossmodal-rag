This suggests that the addition of salt to ice cream serves a purpose beyond just flavor enhancement, potentially contributing to the texture or overall character of the dessert. However, the exact role of salt in ice cream making is not specified in the provided information.\n\nIn a different context, a pinch of salt is added to the mortar. This implies that the mortar, likely a tool used for grinding or pounding, benefits from the addition of salt. The purpose of adding salt to the mortar could be to reduce friction, improve the grinding process, or serve as a preservative.\n\nConsidering the two descriptions, it appears that the term \"pinch of salt\" is used in different ways depending on the context. While the exact mechanisms behind these uses are unclear, it is evident that the addition of salt serves a functional purpose in both instances.\n\nIn summary, a pinch of salt is a seasoning used in ice cream making, contributing to the texture or character of the dessert.
