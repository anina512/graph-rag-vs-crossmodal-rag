It is often employed as a surface to invert or transfer baked goods from a pan or mold to a serving surface. In the case of the \"cake,\" a plate is used to carefully invert the dessert, allowing it to be presented in an upright position. Similarly, when dealing with the \"monkey bread,\" a plate serves as a stable surface to invert the sweet, pull-apart bread, making it easier to serve and portion.\n\nIn both instances, the plate plays a crucial role in the presentation and serving of the baked goods. Its flat surface and sturdy construction make it an ideal tool for inverting and transferring delicate or fragile items. By using a plate, individuals can ensure that their baked creations are presented in a visually appealing manner, which is essential for both personal enjoyment and when serving guests.\n\nIn summary, the \"PLATE\" is a fundamental component in the preparation and presentation of various baked goods, including cakes and monkey bread.
