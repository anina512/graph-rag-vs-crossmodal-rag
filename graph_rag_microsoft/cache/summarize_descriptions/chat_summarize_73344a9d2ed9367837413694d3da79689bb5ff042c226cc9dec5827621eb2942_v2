It is a crucial ingredient in various baked goods, including Baked-Potato Buttermilk Biscuits. This versatile substance plays a significant role in enhancing the texture and flavor of baked items.\n\nAs a leavening agent, BAKING SODA helps to release carbon dioxide gas, which gets trapped in the dough, causing it to rise. This process is essential in creating light and airy textures in baked goods. In the case of Baked-Potato Buttermilk Biscuits, the addition of BAKING SODA contributes to the biscuit's flaky and tender nature.\n\nThe use of BAKING SODA in baking is not limited to biscuits. It is a common ingredient in many recipes, including cakes, cookies, and bread. Its ability to neutralize odors and absorb moisture also makes it a useful addition to various baked goods.\n\nIn summary, BAKING SODA is a fundamental ingredient in baking, particularly in the creation of Baked-Potato Buttermilk Biscuits.
