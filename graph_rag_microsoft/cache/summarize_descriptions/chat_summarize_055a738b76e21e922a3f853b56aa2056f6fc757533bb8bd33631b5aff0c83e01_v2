It is essential to check the top of the cake to ensure that it is cooked through and not undercooked or overcooked. This is because the top of the cake is often the first area to be exposed to heat, and its texture and appearance can indicate the overall doneness of the cake.\n\nIn addition to cakes, the term \"top\" is also used to describe a part of a scone. A scone is a type of baked good that is often served with tea or coffee, and its top is an essential component of its overall structure and appearance. The top of a scone is typically flat and even, and it may be topped with various ingredients such as glazes, frostings, or other sweet or savory toppings.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"top\" is also used in the context of layering cakes. When assembling a layered cake, the top of the second cake layer is typically placed flat side down. This is done to create a stable and even base for the cake, and to ensure that the layers are properly aligned and stacked.\n\nIn summary, the term \"TOP\" refers to a critical component in various baked goods, including cakes and scones.
