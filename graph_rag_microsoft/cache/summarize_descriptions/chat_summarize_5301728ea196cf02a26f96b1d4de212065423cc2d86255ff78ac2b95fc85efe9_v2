It is a key ingredient in various dishes, adding a spicy kick to the flavors.\n\nSambal oelek is primarily used as a condiment to add heat to various Southeast Asian and international dishes. It is often used in small amounts to enhance the flavor of a dish, rather than being the main ingredient. In the case of the Sambal Short Rib Stir-Fry, sambal oelek plays a crucial role in adding a spicy and aromatic flavor to the dish.\n\nContrary to the initial description, sambal oelek is not used to add heat to cakes. Instead, it is commonly used in savory dishes, such as stir-fries, curries, and marinades. The paste is made from ground fresh red chili peppers, garlic, and sometimes vinegar, which gives it a pungent and spicy flavor.\n\nIn terms of its usage, sambal oelek can be used as a marinade, a sauce, or a seasoning. It can be mixed with other ingredients, such as soy sauce, fish sauce, or lime juice, to create a variety of flavors. The paste can also be used as a topping for noodles, rice, or other dishes.\n\nOverall, sambal oelek is a versatile and essential ingredient in Southeast Asian cuisine, adding a spicy and aromatic flavor to various dishes. Its usage is not limited to cakes, but rather it is a key component in many savory dishes, including the Sambal Short Rib Stir-Fry.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763472524, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 327, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
