However, the provided descriptions suggest an alternative context for LINE. \n\nIn this context, LINE refers to a strip of foil used to line a baking sheet. This usage of LINE is a common practice in baking, where a sheet of aluminum foil is placed in a baking sheet to prevent food from sticking and make cleanup easier.\n\nHowever, it is also mentioned that LINE is a company that sells baking supplies. This description seems to be contradictory to the first one, as it implies that LINE is a company that sells baking-related products, rather than a strip of foil used for lining baking sheets.\n\nTo resolve the contradiction, it is likely that the company LINE is the one that sells baking supplies, and the strip of foil used for lining baking sheets is simply a product that the company sells. This would mean that the two descriptions are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary.\n\nIn summary, LINE is a Japanese technology company that provides internet services and mobile payments, but it also sells baking supplies, including a strip of foil used to line a baking sheet.
