It is primarily known as a dipping sauce, often paired with Fish-and-Chips, a popular British dish. This suggests that AIOLI is commonly associated with seafood and is used to add flavor to the dish.\n\nHowever, AIOLI is not limited to being a dipping sauce for Fish-and-Chips. It is also a type of condiment, which implies that it can be used in a variety of ways beyond just being a dipping sauce. This versatility is further reinforced by its use in Chivito, a Uruguayan dish that typically consists of thinly sliced steak, ham, cheese, and eggs, served with mayonnaise-based sauces, including AIOLI.\n\nIn the context of Chivito, AIOLI is used as a condiment to add flavor and moisture to the dish. This suggests that AIOLI has a rich, creamy texture and a mild, slightly tangy flavor that complements the other ingredients in Chivito.\n\nIn summary, AIOLI is a versatile condiment that can be used in a variety of ways, including as a dipping sauce for Fish-and-Chips and as a component of Chivito. Its rich, creamy texture and mild, slightly tangy flavor make it a popular choice for adding flavor and moisture to a range of dishes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763472468, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
