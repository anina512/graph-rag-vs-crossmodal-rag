It is primarily used to prevent food from sticking to cooking surfaces, thereby making food release and cleanup easier. This spray is particularly useful when cooking delicate foods that are prone to sticking, such as eggs, pancakes, and crepes.\n\nIn addition to its primary function, the NONSTICK COOKING SPRAY is also used to lightly spray baking sheets. This helps in preventing food from sticking to the baking sheets, making it easier to remove the cooked food without any residue. The spray is usually applied in a thin, even layer to ensure that the baking sheets are evenly coated.\n\nThe NONSTICK COOKING SPRAY is a convenient and essential tool for many home cooks and professional chefs alike. It is widely available in most supermarkets and kitchen supply stores, and comes in various flavors and scents to suit different cooking needs. When used correctly, the NONSTICK COOKING SPRAY can help to reduce food waste, make cooking and cleaning easier, and add a touch of convenience to the cooking process.\n\nIt is worth noting that the NONSTICK COOKING SPRAY should be used in moderation, as excessive use can lead to a buildup of residue on cooking surfaces. This can affect the non-stick properties of the spray and potentially lead to food sticking to the surfaces. Therefore, it is essential to use the spray as directed and to clean the cooking surfaces regularly to maintain their effectiveness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763471817, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
