It is primarily utilized for stirring and mixing ingredients in different recipes. \n\nIn the context of baking, the Wooden Spoon is used for stirring the dough, ensuring that all the ingredients are well combined and the dough is evenly mixed. This is a crucial step in the baking process, as it helps to develop the gluten in the dough and prevents lumps from forming.\n\nIn addition to its use in baking, the Wooden Spoon is also used to stir milk in the preparation of paneer, a type of Indian cheese. Paneer is made by curdling milk with a acidic substance, such as lemon juice or vinegar, and then straining it through a cheesecloth. The Wooden Spoon is used to gently stir the milk as it cools, helping to prevent the formation of lumps and ensuring that the paneer sets evenly.\n\nThe Wooden Spoon's ability to stir and mix ingredients with ease makes it an essential tool in many kitchens. Its gentle touch and non-reactive properties also make it an ideal choice for working with delicate ingredients, such as milk and cheese.
