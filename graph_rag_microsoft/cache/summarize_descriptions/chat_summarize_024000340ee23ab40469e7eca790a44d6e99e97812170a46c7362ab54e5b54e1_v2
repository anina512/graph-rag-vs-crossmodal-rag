They are often cooked in a broth and served with matzo balls, as part of a traditional dish. In this context, the vegetables are typically not discarded after straining the broth, but rather remain an integral part of the meal. \n\nHowever, in other instances, vegetables can be used as a topping for pizza, where they are added on top of the pizza to provide flavor and texture. In this case, the vegetables are not necessarily cooked in a broth, but rather added raw to the pizza.\n\nAdditionally, vegetables can also be used to make a sauce. This is achieved by mashing them in the roasting pan, where they are cooked and then blended into a sauce. This sauce can then be used as a topping for various dishes, including pizza.\n\nIn general, vegetables are a versatile food that can be used in a variety of ways, from being served as a main dish to being used as a topping or ingredient in other dishes. They are a nutritious and flavorful addition to many meals, and can be prepared in a range of different ways to suit different tastes and preferences.\n\nIn summary, vegetables are a type of food that can be cooked in a broth, used as a topping for pizza, mashed to make a sauce, and served as a main dish.
