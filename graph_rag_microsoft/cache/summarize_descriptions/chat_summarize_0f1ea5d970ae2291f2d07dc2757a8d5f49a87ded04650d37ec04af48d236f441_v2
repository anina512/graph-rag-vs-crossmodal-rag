It is primarily used to line the baking pan, providing a non-stick surface that prevents food from sticking and makes cleanup easier. This is particularly useful when baking delicate items such as cakes, pastries, and cookies.\n\nIn addition to lining the baking pan, FOIL is also used to wrap ingredients in a recipe. This method is often employed to prevent ingredients from coming into contact with other foods, which can lead to cross-contamination and affect the final flavor and texture of the dish. Wrapping ingredients in FOIL also helps to keep them fresh and prevents them from drying out.\n\nThe use of FOIL in cooking and baking offers several benefits. It is easy to use, inexpensive, and can be easily disposed of after use. FOIL is also a good conductor of heat, which allows it to help cook food evenly and efficiently.\n\nOverall, FOIL is a useful and essential tool in the kitchen, providing a convenient and effective way to line baking pans and wrap ingredients in recipes.
