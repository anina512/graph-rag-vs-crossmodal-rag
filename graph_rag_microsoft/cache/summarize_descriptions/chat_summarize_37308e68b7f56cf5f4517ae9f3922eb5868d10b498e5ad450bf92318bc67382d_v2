It is a fundamental component in the preparation of a wide range of baked goods, including bread, pizza, pie crust, doughnuts, gnocchi, cookies, and noodles.\n\nThe mixture of ingredients used to make dough typically includes flour, water, and yeast, which are combined and kneaded to develop the dough's texture and structure. The dough is then rolled, pressed, or stretched to form the desired shape, and it may undergo a process of rising to allow the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide.\n\nDough is used to make a variety of baked goods, such as bread, pizza, and cookies, as well as more specialized items like doughnuts, gnocchi, and noodles. It is also used to make the tart shell and other pastry components.\n\nIn the process of making dough, the ingredients are mixed and kneaded to develop the dough's texture and structure. The dough may then be allowed to rise, which allows the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide.
