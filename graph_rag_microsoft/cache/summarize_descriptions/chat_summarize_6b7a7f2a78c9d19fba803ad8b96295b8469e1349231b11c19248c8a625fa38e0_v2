They are often served alongside a steak, providing a satisfying and filling accompaniment to the main course. However, bones also hold significant value in cooking beyond their role as a side dish. They can be used to make broth, a liquid used in a wide range of recipes to add depth and richness to various dishes. This broth is typically made by simmering the bones in water, allowing the collagen and other nutrients to be extracted and infused into the liquid. The resulting broth can be used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces, or as a standalone ingredient to enhance the flavor of other dishes.
