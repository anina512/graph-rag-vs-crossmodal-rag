They are an essential component in the Hummus Dinner Bowls recipe, adding a tangy flavor and crunchy texture to the dish. In this context, PICKLES are likely used as a topping or mixed into the hummus itself.\n\nAdditionally, PICKLES are also used in a salad, where they are halved and sliced. This suggests that the PICKLES are being used to add a burst of flavor and texture to the salad, possibly as a garnish or mixed into the salad's ingredients.\n\nConsidering both descriptions, it appears that PICKLES are being used in two different ways: as an ingredient in a specific recipe (Hummus Dinner Bowls) and as a topping or mixed ingredient in a salad. There is no apparent contradiction between the two descriptions, and both provide valuable information about the uses of PICKLES.\n\nIn summary, PICKLES are a versatile ingredient used in various culinary applications, including the Hummus Dinner Bowls recipe and salads.
