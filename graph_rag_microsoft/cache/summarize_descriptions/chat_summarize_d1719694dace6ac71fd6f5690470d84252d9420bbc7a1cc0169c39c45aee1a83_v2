This mixture is typically applied to the surface of bread or other baked goods to create a golden-brown finish. However, upon further examination, it appears that the mixture may also include an additional ingredient, salt. \n\nIn this case, the description that includes salt is likely the more accurate representation of an egg wash. The inclusion of salt serves to enhance the flavor and texture of the final product, while also contributing to the characteristic golden-brown color. \n\nTherefore, a comprehensive description of \"Egg Wash\" would be: \n\nEgg wash is a mixture of egg, water, and salt used to brush dough.
