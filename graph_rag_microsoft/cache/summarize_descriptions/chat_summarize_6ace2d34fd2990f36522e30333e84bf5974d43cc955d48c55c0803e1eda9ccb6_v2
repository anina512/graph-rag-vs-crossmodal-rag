This classification is supported by multiple descriptions, including \"Duck is a type of bird\" and \"Duck is a type of bird that is commonly used in cooking.\" This information establishes the \"DUCK\" as a living creature, rather than a food item or ingredient.\n\nHowever, the descriptions also mention the \"DUCK\" in the context of cooking. Specifically, \"A type of bird used for cooking the sauce\" and \"Duck is a type of food being prepared in the recipe\" suggest that the \"DUCK\" is used as an ingredient in a culinary recipe. This implies that the \"DUCK\" is being used for its meat or other edible parts.\n\nTo resolve the apparent contradiction, it can be inferred that the \"DUCK\" is a type of bird that is commonly used as an ingredient in cooking. This means that the \"DUCK\" is a living creature that is raised or hunted for its meat, which is then used in various recipes.\n\nIn summary, the \"DUCK\" is a type of bird that is commonly used as an ingredient in cooking.
