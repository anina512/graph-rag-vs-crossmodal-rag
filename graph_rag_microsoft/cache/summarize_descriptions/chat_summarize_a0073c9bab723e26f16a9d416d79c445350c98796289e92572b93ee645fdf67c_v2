It is primarily utilized to make bagels, a popular bread product. However, it can also be used as a substitute ingredient in certain recipes, such as the 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread. This versatility in application highlights the adaptability of bread flour in different baking contexts.\n\nBread flour is known for its high protein content, which makes it an ideal choice for bread products that require structure and chewiness, such as bagels. The high protein content also allows it to hold its shape well during the baking process. In the case of the 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread recipe, bread flour can be used as a substitute to enhance the overall texture and structure of the bread.\n\nIt is worth noting that bread flour may not be the best choice for all types of bread, particularly those that require a lighter texture. In such cases, all-purpose flour or other types of flour with lower protein content may be more suitable. However, for bread products that require a chewy texture and structure, such as bagels, bread flour is an excellent choice.\n\nIn summary, bread flour is a versatile type of flour used in various baking applications, including the making of bagels and as a substitute ingredient in certain recipes, such as the 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread.
