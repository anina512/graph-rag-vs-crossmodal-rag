It serves as a thickening agent, allowing for the creation of desired textures in various baked goods. This characteristic makes it an essential component in the preparation of pie crust, enabling the development of a consistent and stable structure.\n\nXanthan gum is a polysaccharide derived from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. It is widely used in the food industry due to its unique properties, including its ability to form a stable gel-like substance when mixed with water. This property makes it an effective thickening agent, allowing for the creation of a wide range of textures and consistencies in various food products.\n\nIn baking, xanthan gum is often used in combination with other ingredients to enhance the overall texture and structure of baked goods. It is particularly useful in gluten-free baking, as it helps to replace the binding properties of gluten, which is often lacking in gluten-free flours. By incorporating xanthan gum into gluten-free pie crust recipes, bakers can achieve a more consistent and stable texture, making it easier to work with and resulting in a more desirable final product.\n\nThe use of xanthan gum in baking is not limited to gluten-free applications. It can also be used to enhance the texture and structure of traditional baked goods, such as cakes, cookies, and pastries. Its ability to form a stable gel-like substance makes it an effective thickening agent, allowing for the creation of a wide range of textures and consistencies.\n\nIn summary, Xanthan Gum is a versatile, gluten-free ingredient that serves as a thickening agent in various applications, particularly in baking.
