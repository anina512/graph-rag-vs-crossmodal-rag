It involves moving food from one container to another, allowing for even cooking, cooling, or presentation.\n\nIn the context of cooking, transfer is often used to move noodles from one container to another, as mentioned in the description \"Transfer is a cooking method used to move noodles from one container to another.\" This process helps to prevent overcooking and ensures that the noodles are cooked to the desired level of doneness.\n\nTransfer is also used to move cakes from a baking pan to a wire rack, allowing them to cool completely. This is mentioned in the description \"Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool completely.\" Cooling the cakes on a wire rack helps to prevent sogginess and promotes even cooling.\n\nIn addition to moving noodles and cakes, transfer is also used to move chicken to a wire rack, as mentioned in the description \"Transferring the chicken to a wire rack is part of the recipe.\" This process helps to promote even cooking and prevents the chicken from steaming instead of browning.\n\nIn a specific recipe, transfer is used to move chalupas from one container to a platter, as mentioned in the description \"Transfer chalupas to a platter.\" This process helps to present the chalupas in a visually appealing way and allows for easy serving.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"TRANSFER\" refers to a cooking method used to move food from one container to another, promoting even cooking, cooling, or presentation.
