However, the second description claims that \"Chili paste is a type of food that is being served,\" which suggests that it is a complete dish.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, it is necessary to consider the context in which chili paste is used. In many Asian cuisines, chili paste is a common condiment used to add heat and flavor to various dishes. It is often served on the side, allowing individuals to add it to their meals as desired.\n\nTaking this into account, a more accurate description of \"CHILI PASTE\" would be: \"CHILI PASTE is a type of condiment commonly used in Asian cuisine to add heat and flavor to various dishes.
