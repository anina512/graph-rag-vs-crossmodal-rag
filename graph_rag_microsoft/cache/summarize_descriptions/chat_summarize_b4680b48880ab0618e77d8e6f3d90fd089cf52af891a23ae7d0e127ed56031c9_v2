It is a fundamental part of a wide range of sweet and savory treats, including baked goods, tarts, and pies. \n\nIn the context of baked goods, the crust serves as a base or outer layer, providing structure and texture to the final product. It is often made from a mixture of ingredients, such as flour, water, and fat, which are combined and then baked in the oven until golden brown.\n\nThe crust is also a key component of tarts, which are a type of baked good characterized by a pastry crust filled with sweet or savory ingredients. In this context, the crust serves as the foundation for the tart, providing a base for the filling and adding texture and flavor to the final product.\n\nFurthermore, the crust is a component of pies, which are baked goods filled with sweet or savory ingredients and topped with a pastry crust. The crust in this case serves as a protective layer, preventing the filling from escaping during baking and adding flavor and texture to the final product.\n\nIn addition to its role in baked goods, the crust is also a part of a loaf of bread. In this context, the crust refers to the outer layer of the bread, which is formed during the baking process and provides texture and flavor to the final product.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"CRUST\" is a versatile component that plays a crucial role in a wide range of baked goods, including baked goods, tarts, pies, and bread.
