Specifically, it is used to bake \"BREAD.\" The process of baking bread in the oven involves placing the dough inside the oven, where it is exposed to heat, causing the bread to rise and cook.\n\nIn this context, the \"OVEN\" serves as a crucial tool for transforming raw bread dough into a cooked, edible product. The heat from the oven causes the starches in the dough to break down, resulting in a crispy crust and a soft interior.\n\nThe relationship between the \"OVEN\" and the \"BREAD\" is one of functionality and purpose. The oven is designed to facilitate the baking process, while the bread is the end product that results from this process.\n\nIn summary, the \"OVEN\" is a cooking appliance used to bake \"BREAD.\" The baking process involves placing the bread dough inside the oven, where it is exposed to heat, causing it to cook and rise.
