It is known for its durability and resistance to heat, making it an ideal material for containers that need to withstand high temperatures. In the context of food storage, ceramic is often used to make yogurt containers, which suggests its non-reactive and safe properties for storing food.\n\nHowever, ceramic is also mentioned in relation to a mixture that needs to be poured into a container that won't crack from heat. This implies that ceramic is not only suitable for storing food but also for containing mixtures that require heat, such as when cooking or baking.\n\nConsidering the information collected from both descriptions, it appears that ceramic is a versatile material that can be used in a variety of settings, including food storage and cooking. Its heat-resistant properties make it an ideal choice for containers that need to withstand high temperatures.\n\nIn summary, ceramic is a type of material that is known for its durability and heat resistance, making it suitable for a range of applications, including food storage and cooking.
