The wire rack provides air circulation around the cake, which helps to speed up the cooling process and prevents the cake from sticking to the surface it's placed on.\n\nIn terms of the \"WIRE RACK\" itself, it is a kitchen tool designed to facilitate the cooling of baked goods, such as cakes. The rack's design allows for air to circulate around the cake, promoting even cooling and preventing moisture buildup. This is particularly important for delicate baked goods that can be easily damaged by excessive moisture.\n\nBy combining the information from both descriptions, it's clear that the \"WIRE RACK\" plays a crucial role in the cooling process of \"CAKE.\" The rack's design and functionality make it an essential tool for bakers, allowing them to produce high-quality cakes that are evenly cooled and free from moisture-related issues.\n\nIn summary, the \"CAKE\" is typically cooled on a \"WIRE RACK,\" which provides air circulation and helps to speed up the cooling process.
