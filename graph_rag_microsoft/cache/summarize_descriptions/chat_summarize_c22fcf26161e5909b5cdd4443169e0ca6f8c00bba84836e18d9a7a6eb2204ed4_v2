The juices from the roasted \"TURKEY\" are used to make the \"GRAVY,\" which is then served alongside the \"TURKEY\" as a complement to its flavor.\n\nIn summary, the \"TURKEY\" and \"GRAVY\" are intimately connected in a cooking context. The \"TURKEY\" is the primary source of the \"GRAVY,\" and the \"GRAVY\" is served alongside the \"TURKEY\" to enhance its flavor.
