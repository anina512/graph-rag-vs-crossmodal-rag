They are a key ingredient in several dishes, including Mujadara, Curried Chicken Drumsticks, Mexican Fiesta Casserole, and Baked Tomatoes with Crusty Bread. \n\nIn terms of preparation, onions are typically chopped and then cooked in a large pot until they are soft but not brown. However, they can also be sweated in a skillet over medium heat until tender and lightly browned, which takes around 8 to 10 minutes. \n\nOnions are often cooked in olive oil, as seen in the Mujadara recipe.
