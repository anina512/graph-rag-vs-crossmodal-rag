They are a common component in many dishes, often serving as a key ingredient in numerous culinary creations. This suggests that TOMATOES are a fundamental element in cooking, adding flavor, texture, and nutritional value to a wide range of recipes.\n\nHowever, one description mentions that TOMATOES are a type of food used in baking.

Nevertheless, this description is not the primary characteristic of TOMATOES.\n\nAnother description states that TOMATOES are a type of fruit that can be used in recipes.
