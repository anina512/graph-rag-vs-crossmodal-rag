A common practice is to serve chicken and garlic together in traditional Spanish dishes, such as paella. This combination is not only a staple in Spanish cuisine but also a popular choice in many other parts of the world.\n\nIn terms of cooking methods, chicken is frequently prepared with garlic, which adds a rich and savory flavor to the dish.
