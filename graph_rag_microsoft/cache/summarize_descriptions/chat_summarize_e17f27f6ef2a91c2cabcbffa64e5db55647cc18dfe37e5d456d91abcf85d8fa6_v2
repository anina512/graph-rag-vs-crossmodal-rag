This is a common understanding of the term, where a sponge is a utensil used in cooking and baking.\n\nHowever, the other descriptions suggest that the term \"sponge\" can also refer to a mixture of ingredients, specifically a type of bread starter. This mixture typically consists of flour, water, and other ingredients that ferment to produce carbon dioxide, causing the dough to rise. This concept is often associated with the process of making bread, where the sponge is used as a leavening agent.\n\nTo resolve the contradictions, it is clear that the term \"sponge\" can have multiple meanings depending on the context. In the context of cooking and baking, a sponge refers to a kitchen tool used for mixing and blending ingredients. In the context of bread making, a sponge refers to a mixture of ingredients that ferments to produce carbon dioxide, causing the dough to rise.\n\nIn summary, the \"SPONGE\" can refer to either a kitchen tool used for mixing and blending ingredients or a mixture of ingredients used as a bread starter.
