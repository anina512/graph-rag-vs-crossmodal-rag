However, the provided descriptions seem to be contradictory, as one describes it as a dessert made from cream and sugar, while the other mentions it being spread in the crusts, which is more characteristic of a filling or a topping.\n\nTo resolve the contradiction, it is likely that \"CURD\" refers to a type of filling or topping, rather than a standalone dessert. This is supported by the fact that it is being spread in the crusts, which is a common practice in pastry-making.\n\nA more comprehensive description of \"CURD\" would be that it is a type of filling or topping made from cream and sugar, often used in baked goods such as pies and tarts. It is typically spread or poured into the crust of a pastry, where it adds flavor and texture to the finished product.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"CURD\" may be used in different contexts, and the above description may not be applicable in all cases.
