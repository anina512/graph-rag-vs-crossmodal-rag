The descriptions \"Glaze is poured over the cookies\" and \"Glaze is spread over the cookies\" both indicate that the glaze is applied to the cookies, but they differ in the method of application.\n\nTo resolve the contradiction, it is likely that both methods are used, depending on the desired effect or the type of cookies being made. In some cases, the glaze may be poured over the cookies to create a smooth, even layer, while in other cases, it may be spread over the cookies to add a decorative touch or to fill in any gaps.\n\nIn general, the application of glaze to cookies is a common practice in baking, and it serves to enhance the flavor, texture, and appearance of the cookies. The glaze can be made from a variety of ingredients, including sugar, water, and flavorings, and it can be colored or flavored to match the desired theme or occasion.\n\nIn summary, the entity \"COOKIES\" is a type of baked good that is often paired with the entity \"GLAZE\", a sweet, syrupy liquid used to add flavor and visual appeal.
