The process of making CAKES involves baking them in an oven, which is a crucial step in their preparation. After being baked, the CAKES are then cooled completely, allowing them to reach a stable temperature and texture. This cooling process is essential to ensure that the CAKES are safe to consume and have the desired consistency.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"main dish\" is often associated with savory or meat-based dishes, rather than sweet desserts like CAKES.
