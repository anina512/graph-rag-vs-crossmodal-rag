It serves as a platform to hold the food during the baking process, allowing for even cooking and preventing the food from coming into direct contact with the oven's heating elements. \n\nIn particular, the \"BAKING SHEET\" is used to hold a pie during baking in the \"OVEN\". This ensures that the pie is cooked evenly and prevents it from being damaged by the oven's heat. \n\nFurthermore, the \"OVEN\" and \"BAKING SHEET\" are used together to bake brioches. The \"BAKING SHEET\" provides a surface for the brioches to cook on, while the \"OVEN\" supplies the necessary heat to cook the brioches to perfection. \n\nIn summary, the \"OVEN\" and \"BAKING SHEET\" are complementary entities that work together to facilitate the baking process. The \"BAKING SHEET\" serves as a platform for holding food during baking, while the \"OVEN\" provides the necessary heat to cook the food.
