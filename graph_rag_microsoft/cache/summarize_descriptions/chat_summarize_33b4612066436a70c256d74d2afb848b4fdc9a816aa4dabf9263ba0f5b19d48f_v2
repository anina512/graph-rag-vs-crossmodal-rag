In the context of baking, STEP 4 refers to the process of letting the dough rise until it is approximately doubled in size. This step is essential in allowing the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide, which causes the dough to expand.\n\nHowever, in a different context, STEP 4 is associated with the preparation of a Sashimi Salad with Soy and Orange. In this case, STEP 4 is not directly related to the rising of dough but rather a step in the recipe that needs to be repeated for each egg. Unfortunately, the description does not provide further information on what this step entails.\n\nGiven the contradictory information, it is challenging to provide a single, coherent summary. However, based on the available data, it can be inferred that STEP 4 is a process that can be applied in different contexts, including baking and cooking. In the context of baking, STEP 4 is a step in the dough rising process, while in the context of the Sashimi Salad recipe, STEP 4 is a step that needs to be repeated for each egg.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive summary, additional information is required to clarify the context and purpose of STEP 4 in the Sashimi Salad recipe. Nevertheless, the available data suggests that STEP 4 is an essential step in various processes, and its specific application depends on the context in which it is used.\n\nIn summary, STEP 4 is a process that can be applied in different contexts, including baking and cooking.
