They are classified as a type of stone fruit, which is a category of fruits that have a hard pit or stone in the center. This classification is evident in their use in the Tiger Fruit Salad, where they are combined with other fruits to create a unique and flavorful dish.\n\nIn addition to their use in savory dishes, mangoes are also used in baking. Their sweet and creamy flavor makes them a popular choice for sweet treats, such as cakes, muffins, and other baked goods. The versatility of mangoes in both sweet and savory applications is a testament to their culinary value.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"stone fruit\" can sometimes be misleading, as it implies that the fruit has a stone or pit that is inedible. However, in the case of mangoes, the pit is typically removed before consumption, and the fruit is enjoyed for its sweet and juicy flesh. This clarification helps to provide a more accurate understanding of the characteristics of mangoes.\n\nOverall, mangoes are a delicious and versatile fruit that can be used in a wide range of culinary applications. Whether they are used in a sweet baked good or a savory salad, mangoes are sure to add flavor and excitement to any dish.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763471285, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 457, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
