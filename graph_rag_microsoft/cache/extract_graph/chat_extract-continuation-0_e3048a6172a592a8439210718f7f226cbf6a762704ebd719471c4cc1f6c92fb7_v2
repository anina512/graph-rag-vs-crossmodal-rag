Wrap bone tips in foil to prevent burning. Roast until meat is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of roast registers 135°F, about 25 minutes longer. Transfer pork to a carving board and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, stir sugar and 1/4 cup lemon juice in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and cook without stirring, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush, until caramel is deep amber, about 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat; gradually whisk in orange juice and bourbon. Set pan over medium heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in reserved orange zest, broth, and marmalade. Boil until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Set caramel sauce aside.\nWhisk cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl; set aside. Transfer orange slices from roasting pan to a warm platter. Spoon off and discard fat from drippings in pan. Place roasting pan over 2 burners set at medium heat. Pour in reserved caramel sauce; set saucepan aside. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits from bottom of roasting pan. Boil for 30 seconds, then return sauce to reserved saucepan. Stir in liqueur. Bring sauce to a boil; whisk in cornstarch mixture. Boil, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Season sauce to taste with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.\nSlice roasts between rib bones to make individual chops. Arrange chops on top of orange slices on platter. Serve with burnt orange-caramel sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROAST<|>EVENT<|>Roast is a cooking method where meat is cooked in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pork is a type of meat used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is a liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange juice is a liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bourbon is a type of liquor used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange zest is a component of the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Broth is a liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARMALADE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Marmalade is a type of preserve used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caramel sauce is a type of sauce used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornstarch is a type of starch used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUEUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Liqueur is a type of liquor used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST<|>PORK<|>Roast is a cooking method for pork<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>Lemon juice and orange juice are both used in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOURBON<|>LIQUEUR<|>Bourbon is a type of liqueur used in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>Orange zest and orange juice are both used in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROTH<|>MARMALADE<|>Broth and marmalade are both used in the recipe<|>8"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
