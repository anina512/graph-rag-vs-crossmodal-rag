Smash garlic cloves, then chop coarsely. Pulse herbs, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon oil in a food processor until smooth. Place lamb in a 13\" x 9\" glass baking dish; rub with garlic mixture; cover; refrigerate 1 hour. Remove from fridge and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before grilling. Cook couscous as directed on package; transfer to a bowl. Toss with 2 teaspoon oil, cherry tomatoes and basil. Season with salt and pepper; set aside. Make raita: Heat oven to 375°F. Toss tomato slices with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and spread on a baking sheet; roast until tomatoes brown in spots, about 30 minutes. Grind cumin seeds to a fine powder in a coffee grinder or spice mill. Puree roasted tomato in a blender with cumin, yogurt, cucumber and sugar until smooth. Stir in mint. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until ready to eat. Heat grill to medium-high heat (about 375°F). Grill lamb, about 2 minutes per side for medium. Remove from grill and let rest 10 minutes; cut into 1-inch-thick slices. Divide couscous and lamb among 4 plates. Serve with 1 tablespoon raita per plate.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including entity recognition, relationship extraction, and text processing.
