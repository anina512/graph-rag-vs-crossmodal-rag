Wash the rhubarb, trim off the ends of the stalks, then slice them crosswise into 1/2-inch chunks. If the stalks are very thick, halve them lengthwise first. Toss with the sugar, tapioca, orange juice, zest, and cloves. Arrange in an 8 x 10-inch gratin dish and let stand while you preheat the oven to 400°F. Cover with foil and bake until the fruit is tender when pierced with a knife, 35 to 45 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, if you're using strawberries, rinse them quickly, then slice thickly. Plunge mulberries briefly into water and remove any stems. When the rhubarb is done, remove it from the oven, scatter the berries over the top, and let stand with a piece of foil placed loosely over the top. The heat of the rhubarb will open the flavor of the berries, cooking them slightly. Serve chilled or at room temperature, garnished with cream and crème fraîche whipped together until billowy, and the candied ginger.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rhubarb is a type of vegetable often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berries are a type of fruit often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDIED GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Candied ginger is a type of sweet and spicy condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange is a type of citrus fruit often used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRAWBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strawberries are a type of fruit often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mulberries are a type of fruit often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blackberries are a type of fruit often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream is a type of dairy product often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crème fraîche is a type of dairy product often used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of root often used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB WITH BERRIES AND CANDIED GINGER<|>EVENT<|>Rhubarb with berries and candied ginger is a type of dessert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHUBARB<|>BERRIES<|>Rhubarb is often paired with berries in desserts<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHUBARB<|>CANDIED GINGER<|>Rhubarb is often paired with candied ginger in desserts<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERRIES<|>CANDIED GINGER<|>Berries are often paired with candied ginger in desserts<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORANGE<|>RHUBARB<|>Orange is often used in rhubarb desserts<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STRAWBERRIES<|>RHUBARB<|>Straw"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
