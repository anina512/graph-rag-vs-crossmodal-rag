(25 g) granulated sugar', '1½ tsp. vanilla extract', '1 tsp. kosher salt', '½ tsp. baking soda', '¾ cup assorted dried fruit (cut into ½\" pieces if large)', '¾ cup chopped bittersweetchocolate bars or chips or disks', '½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour', 'Flaky sea salt']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast nuts and seeds and oats on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool.\nMeanwhile, mix egg, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; let sit until nuts are cool (this will make for a chewier cookie).\nAdd dried fruit and chocolate to nut mixture; toss to combine. Give egg mixture a good stir, then stir in flour. Mix in nut mixture, smashing it against the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until combined and mix-ins are evenly coated in dough. (It will look like too many mix-ins, but dough will come together as it chills.) Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.\nReheat oven to 350°F. Using a ⅓-cup measure or #16 cookie scoop, portion out dough, packing firmly, to make 12 cookies. Divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets as you go. Using measuring cup or your hand, press cookies into 2½\"-diameter disks about ¾\" thick; sprinkle with sea salt.\nBake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back once, until golden brown and no longer wet-looking, 11–13 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.\nDo Ahead: Cookies can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_569d3861254197feccf77cce4b9a3d7017b48236f20c718c32ee5f65afa1709b_v2"}
