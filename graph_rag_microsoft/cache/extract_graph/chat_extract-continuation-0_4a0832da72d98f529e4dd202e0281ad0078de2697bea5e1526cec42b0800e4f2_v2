On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12\" round (if dough springs back, cover with plastic and let rest 5 minutes, then roll again, resting as needed).\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high until very hot. Carefully transfer dough to skillet. Brush top of dough with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Cook, shaking pan occasionally and turning pan to avoid hot spots, until bottom of dough is golden brown and crispy, 3–4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, toss turkey with 1/4 cup cranberry sauce, if using, in a medium bowl.\nRemove skillet from heat. Using a large flat spatula, flip dough. Spread potatoes over dough, leaving a 3/4\" border on all sides; season with salt and pepper. Top with 1 cup cheese, then turkey mixture, vegetables, and onion. Top with remaining 1 cup cheese and red pepper flakes, if using. Bake pizza until dough is golden brown and cheese is melted, 6–8 minutes.\nTransfer pizza to a cutting board and cut into wedges. Serve with additional cranberry sauce alongside, if using.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>THANKSGIVING SKILLET PIZZA<|>EVENT<|>Thanksgiving Skillet Pizza is a recipe for a delicious pizza dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIZZA DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pizza dough is a type of dough used to make pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHREDDED COOKED TURKEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shredded cooked turkey is a type of meat used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cranberry sauce is a type of sauce used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASHED WHITE OR SWEET POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mashed white or sweet potatoes are a type of side dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a type of spice used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mozzarella cheese is a type of cheese used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEDDAR CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheddar cheese is a type of cheese used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FONTINA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fontina cheese is a type of cheese used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKED VEGETABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cooked vegetables are a type of side dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red onion is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron skillet is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
