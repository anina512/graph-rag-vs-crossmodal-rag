Gently mix in parsley, chives, dill, and tarragon; season with salt and pepper.\nPlace potatoes and bay leaf in a large pot and pour in cold water to cover by 2\"; season generously with salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15–20 minutes. Drain, discard bay leaf, and let potatoes cool slightly. Using the flat side of a chef’s knife or the heel of your hand, smash potatoes lightly to flatten.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add half of potatoes and cook in a single layer, turning once, until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer potatoes to bowl with herb butter. Wipe out skillet, repeat process with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and remaining potatoes. Toss potatoes in butter until they are all well coated (the warm potatoes should melt the butter).\nHerb butter can be made 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Potatoes can be boiled and smashed 1 day ahead; let cool, then cover and chill.
