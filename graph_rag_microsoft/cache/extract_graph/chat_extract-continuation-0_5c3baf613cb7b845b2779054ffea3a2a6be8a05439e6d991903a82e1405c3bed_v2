Grease a 10x16-inch rimmed sheet pan with 1 tablespoon room-temperature butter and set aside.\nPlace the Oreos in the bowl of a food processor and pulverize until fine. Add the melted butter and continue to process until the crumbs hold together when squeezed, about five (1-second) pulses. Turn the cookie crumbs out onto the prepared sheet pan and, with the bottom of a measuring cup, press them to the edges of the prepared pan in an even layer. (Don’t worry about working the crumbs up the sides of the pan.) Bake the crust until it is set, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.\nAdd the chocolate and 1 1/4 cups cream to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 20-second increments, stirring between each, until the chocolate is completely melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Whisk until glossy and smooth. Whisk in the remaining tablespoon of room-temperature butter and pour the chocolate mixture over the baked crust, spreading it evenly with an offset spatula. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the filling is completely set, about 2 hours.\nCombine the remaining 1 1/4 cups cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla in a medium-size bowl. Beat with a handheld mixer or a whisk (or using a stand mixer fitted with a whisk) at medium-high speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks. Spread the cream over the chocolate filling. Slice into 20 bars and serve. The bars will keep in an airtight container (or in the sheet pan covered with plastic wrap) in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE SQUARES<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate Cream Pie Squares is a dessert recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OREO COOKIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oreo is a brand of cookies used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Semisweet chocolate is a type of chocolate used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Confectioners sugar is a type of sugar used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PURE VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pure vanilla extract is a type of flavoring used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>UNSAULTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Room temperature butter is a type of butter used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MELTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Melted butter is a type of butter used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FOOD PROCESSOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Food processor is a kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEASURING CUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Measuring cup is a kitchen tool used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OFFSET SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Offset spatula is a kitchen tool used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HANDHELD MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Handheld mixer is a kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stand mixer is a kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
