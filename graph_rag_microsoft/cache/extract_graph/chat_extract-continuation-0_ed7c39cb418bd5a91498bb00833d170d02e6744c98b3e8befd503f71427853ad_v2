Stir continuously and break up any lumps of sugar—this will help the sugar caramelize evenly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring with a spatula to dissolve the sugar, then simmer, without stirring, until the caramel turns the color of a copper penny (or an Irish setter), about 4 minutes. If, while the caramel cooks, any sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, brush down the sides with a clean, wet pastry brush. Reduce the heat to low, and slowly add 1/2 cup of the cream (the caramel will rise and bubble and might spit, so be careful). Stir until the cream is well incorporated into the caramel. Remove from the heat and stir in salt. Should the caramel seize and harden, return the mixture to the heat and stir until it softens. Remove from heat and set aside.\nPrepare an ice bath in a large bowl and set another bowl over it. Set aside.Pour the milk and remaining 1 1/2 cups cream into a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Add the vanilla bean seeds and pod and warm the mixture until you see steam rising from the top.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with a kitchen towel underneath it to prevent slipping, whisk together the egg yolks until uniform. While whisking, add a splash of the hot dairy mixture to the yolks. Continue to add the dairy mixture, whisking it in bit by bit, until you’ve added about half. Add the yolk mixture to the remaining dairy mixture in the double boiler, and stir in the caramel. Set the heat under the double boiler to medium and cook the custard, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and reducing the heat to medium-low as necessary, until steam begins to rise from the surface and the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally and run your finger through the custard.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use a library like spaCy to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract entities of the specified types (organization, person, geo, event) and format them as required.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    # Process the text\n    doc = nlp(text)\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store entities\n    entities = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities in the document\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        # Check if the entity type is in the specified types\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            # Extract the entity information\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n\n            # Format the entity as required\n            entity = f\"({entity_type}|{entity_name}|{entity_description})\"\n\n            # Add the entity to the list\n            entities.append(entity)\n\n    return entities\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities**\n\nWe'll define a function to extract relationships between entities.
