Coat a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with coconut oil or olive oil cooking spray and set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, curry, lemon juice, oregano, and tamari soy sauce.

Using a cooking brush, baste the salmon with the marinade, cover, and place into the fridge for about 30 minutes.\nRemove the salmon from the fridge, and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Bake, on middle rack, for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. The salmon should feel slightly firm to the touch.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, curry powder, lemon juice, honey, and tamari soy sauce until well combined. Add the kale, quinoa, and red onion to the bowl and toss gently to coat with the dressing.
