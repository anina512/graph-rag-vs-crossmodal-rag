Snip through any gristle with kitchen shears (to prevent curling), then pat steaks dry.\nMix together flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and dredge steaks on all sides, shaking off excess.\nHeat reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat until it shimmers, then brown steaks on both sides in batches; transfer to a plate.\nAdd onion to skillet with remaining tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently and scraping up brown bits, until softened and browned, about 10 minutes.\nAdd steaks with any meat juices and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, tightly covered, over low heat until meat is very tender, about 1 1/4 hours. If sauce is thin, transfer meat to a platter and boil until reduced to about 1 cup.
