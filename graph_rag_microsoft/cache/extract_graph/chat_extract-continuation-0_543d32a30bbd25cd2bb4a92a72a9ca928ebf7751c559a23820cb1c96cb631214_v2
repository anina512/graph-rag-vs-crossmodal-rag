Add the butter and 2 teaspoons salt. Cover and cook on LOW until the polenta is thick and tender, about 6 hours.\nWith the slow cooker on LOW, stir the polenta well and then stir the spinach into the polenta in 2 batches, covering the cooker and letting the first batch wilt before adding the second, about 5 minutes per batch.\nMeanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss together the tomatoes, oil, and vinegar. Season the tomato salad with salt and pepper.\nOptional: Pour a thin layer of oil into a large skillet over medium-high heat and crack 4 eggs into the pan. Season the eggs with salt and pepper and cook until the whites are golden brown, lacy on the edges, and just set in the middle, and the yolks are still a little jiggly, about 3 minutes.\nFold the Parmesan and ricotta into the polenta. Taste and season the polenta with salt if necessary. Stir in warm water by the tablespoon if the polenta is looking too thick for your taste—keep in mind it will continue to thicken as it cools. Top bowls of the polenta with the tomato salad and, if you like, the fried eggs.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Code\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    entities = defaultdict(list)\n    for entity_type in entity_types:\n        if entity_type == 'organization':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b'\n            matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n            for match in matches:\n                entities[entity_type].append({\n                    'entity_name': match.upper(),\n                    'entity_type': entity_type,\n                    'entity_description': f\"{match} is an organization\"\n                })\n        elif entity_type == 'person':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b'\n            matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n            for match in matches:\n                entities[entity_type].append({\n                    'entity_name': match.upper(),\n                    'entity_type': entity_type,\n                    'entity_description': f\"{match} is a person\"\n                })\n        elif entity_type == 'geo':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b'\n            matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n            for match in matches:\n                entities[entity_type].append({\n                    'entity_name': match.upper(),\n                    'entity_type': entity_type,\n                    'entity_description': f\"{match} is a geographic location\"\n                })\n        elif entity_type == 'event':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b'\n            matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n            for match in matches:\n                entities[entity_type].append({\n                    'entity_name': match.upper(),\n                    'entity_type': entity_type,\n                    'entity_description': f\"{match} is an event\"\n                })\n    return entities\n\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for entity in entities[entity_type]:\n            for other_entity_type in entities:\n                if other_entity_type != entity_type:\n                    for other_entity in entities[other_entity_type]:\n                        relationship_description = f\"{entity['entity_name']} is related to {other_entity['entity_name']}\"\n                        relationship_strength = 1\n                        relationships.append({\n                            'source_entity': entity['entity_name'],\n                            'target_entity': other_entity['entity_name'],\n                            'relationship_description': relationship_description,\n                            'relationship_strength': relationship_strength\n                        })\n    return relationships\n\ndef format_output(entities, relationships):\n    output = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for entity in entities[entity_type]:\n            output.append(f\"('entity'<|>{"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
