Cut the lamb into 1 inch cubes. Place in a Ziploc bag and add the rest of the ingredients. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour.\n2. Turn your oven to broil and skewer the cubes on the chopsticks. If the chopsticks are not lacquered then place them in water for an hour before use, so they won't char in the oven.\n3. Grill the skewers in the top of your oven for about 12 minutes or until completely cooked through. Turn after half the time.\n1. Peel and chop the pistachio nuts. Add to a small saucepan and roast for 2 minutes or until hot. Lower the heat and add the mint gel, letting it melt over low heat.\n2. Add the peppers to taste. By stirring the peppers, they will cook more evenly.\nLamb that is grain fed has a less gamey flavor than the grass-fed lamb. So if you usually don't like lamb because it is gamey, try grain-fed lamb.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>LAMB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lamb is a type of meat that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT MINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot mint is a type of sauce that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pistachio is a type of nut that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is a type of ingredient that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZIPLOC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ziploc is a type of bag that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOPSTICKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chopsticks are a type of utensil that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAYENNE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cayenne is a type of pepper that is often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person who is cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT<|>EVENT<|>Event is a type of cooking event)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAMB<|>HOT MINT<|>Lamb is often paired with hot mint in cooking<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAMB<|>PISTACHIO<|>Lamb is often paired with pistachio in cooking<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOT MINT<|>PISTACHIO<|>Hot mint and pistachio are often used together in cooking<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>LAMB<|>Samuel is cooking lamb<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>HOT MINT<|>Samuel is using hot mint in cooking<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PISTACHIO<|>Samuel is using pistachio in cooking<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
