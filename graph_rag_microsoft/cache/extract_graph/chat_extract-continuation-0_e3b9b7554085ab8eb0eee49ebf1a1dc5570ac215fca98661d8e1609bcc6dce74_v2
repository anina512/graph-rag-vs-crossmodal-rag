Add black pepper, poultry seasoning, and miso paste and purée until smooth. Add butter and purée — mixture will appear curdled.\nPut oven rack in lowest position and preheat to 350°F. Rinse turkey inside and out, then pat dry. Working from large cavity end, gently run fingers between skin and meat of breast to loosen skin, being careful not to tear skin. Push miso butter under skin, including thighs and drumsticks, and massage from outside to spread evenly. Place a lemon slice inside of a pepper ring and slide under skin, positioning evenly over breast and drumsticks. Repeat with remaining pepper and lemon slices until a pleasing pattern results. Sprinkle cavity with seasoned salt. Stuff cavity with lemon and orange quarters, squeezing juice into cavity as you go, and fold neck skin and flap into the cavity. Tie drumsticks together with kitchen string and tuck wings under body.\nRub turkey with 2 tablespoons of oil.
