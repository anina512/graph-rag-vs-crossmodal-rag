Melt butter with 2 tablespoons oil in small saucepan over medium heat. Add fish sauce mixture and green onions and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.\nDo ahead: Butter sauce can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.\nPreheat barbecue (medium-high heat). Brush corn with oil. Grill corn until tender and charred in spots, about 13 minutes. Brush corn generously with butter sauce and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.\n*Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient. Try it (1) mixed with garlic and cilantro as a marinade for grilled chicken; (2) in barbecue sauce for ribs; (3) in a salad of slivered green apples and chopped cilantro; and (4) in a compound butter with cayenne and shallots for grilled fish. It is available in the Asian foods section of many supermarkets and at Asian markets.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GRILLED CORN<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Corn is a dish made with corn, fish sauce, and green onions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>Asian Glaze is a sweet-savory sauce made with fish sauce, water, sugar, and black pepper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Fish sauce is a versatile ingredient used in various dishes, including Grilled Corn and Asian Glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN ONIONS<|>EVENT<|>Green onions are used as a garnish in Grilled Corn and Asian Glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNU<|>GEO<|>Corn is a type of food that is often grilled)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAN MARKETS<|>GEO<|>Asian markets sell fish sauce and other ingredients used in Grilled Corn and Asian Glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERMARKETS<|>GEO<|>Supermarkets sell fish sauce and other ingredients used in Grilled Corn and Asian Glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARBECUE<|>EVENT<|>Barbecue is a method of cooking used to grill corn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Chicken is a type of food that can be marinated with garlic and cilantro)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIBS<|>EVENT<|>Ribs are a type of food that can be cooked with barbecue sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>EVENT<|>Apples are a type of food that can be used in a salad with cilantro)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH<|>EVENT<|>Fish is a type of food that can be cooked with a compound butter)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRILLED CORN<|>ASIAN GLAZE<|>Grilled Corn is made with Asian Glaze<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASIAN GLAZE<|>FISH SAUCE<|>Asian Glaze is made with fish sauce<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH SAUCE<|>GREEN ONIONS<|>Fish sauce is used with green onions in Grilled Corn and Asian Glaze<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRILLED"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
