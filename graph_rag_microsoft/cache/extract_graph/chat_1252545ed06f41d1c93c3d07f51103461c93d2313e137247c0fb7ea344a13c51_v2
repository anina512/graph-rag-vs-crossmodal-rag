Heat a panini press according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, heat a ridged grill pan or large skillet over medium heat.\n2. Using a serrated knife, cut the roll in half horizontally. Spread each cut side of the roll with 1 tablespoon of the fig jam, drizzle the jam with 1 teaspoon of the oil, and season it with the salt. Arrange the Cheddar pieces closely on the bottom roll half, being sure that the cheese does not hang over the sides of the roll. Cover it with the remaining roll half, jam-side down.\n3. Place the sandwich in the panini press and cook it until the roll is toasted and golden brown and the cheese is desirably melty, about 4 minutes, depending on the press. If using a ridged grill pan or skillet, place the sandwich in the pan and top it with a cast-iron skillet or heavy saucepan. Cook until the underside is toasted, about 2 minutes. Flip the sandwich over, top it with the cast-iron skillet again, and cook until the other side is toasted and the cheese is melty, about 2 minutes more.\n4. Cut the sandwich in half and serve it hot.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1252545ed06f41d1c93c3d07f51103461c93d2313e137247c0fb7ea344a13c51_v2"}
