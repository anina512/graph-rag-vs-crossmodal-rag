Combine cornstarch, lemon zest, salt, pepper (if using), and 1/3 cup sugar in a medium bowl. Toss with your hands to combine, then add strawberries and toss to coat. Add lemon juice and vanilla; toss gently.\nArrange berry mixture in the center of chilled dough (still on parchment on baking sheet) and spread out evenly, leaving a 3\" border. Fold edges of dough up and over fruit, pleating as needed and being careful that folded edge of dough doesn’t tear (if it does, patch with dough scraps and pinch to seal). Pour cream into a small bowl and brush all over dough. Sprinkle sugar evenly over dough.\nPlace galette in oven and immediately reduce heat to 375°F. Bake, rotating halfway through, until crust is deep golden brown everywhere, berries are softened, and juices are bubbling, 45–50 minutes. Let cool 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_31f572516907ae2af8284e5d4c14961d8e63b11e18dcceaa7631a30b3ebc5ce1_v2"}
