In a plastic (preferably) container large enough to hold both the brine and the meat, mix together the water, maple syrup, salt, cure, and spices.\n2. Scoop out a scant 1 cup (200 ml) brine, and use it to load the brine injector. Then, inject the loin every 3/4 to 1 inch (2 to 2.5 cm), inserting the needle about 3/4 inch (2 cm) deep. Try to distribute the brine evenly over the loin. Place the loin in the container with the remaining brine, and keep the meat submerged with the help of a plate or an object of a similar build. Cover and refrigerate for 4 full days.\n3. Remove the loin from the brine and pat it dry. Then roll it in the meal of your choosing. Give it a day's rest, uncovered, in the fridge, so the meal and meat form as one.\n4. You have two options on cooking it: you can slice it and griddle it for a minute on each side (for thin slices that is), or you can bake it at 375°F (190°C) for about an hour, or until it has a core temperature of 142°F (61°C), then slice it. I like it the first way, especially when it gets a bit burnt on the edges and I have added a dash of maple syrup that caramelizes a bit toward the end.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PEAMEAL BACON<|>EVENT<|>Peameal Bacon is a type of cured meat that is made from pork loin and is typically rolled in cornmeal or peas before being cooked)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BONELESS LEAN PORK LOIN<|>EVENT<|>Boneless lean pork loin is the main ingredient used to make Peameal Bacon)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Maple syrup is used in the brine to give Peameal Bacon its distinctive flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORNMEAL<|>EVENT<|>Cornmeal is used to roll the Peameal Bacon in before it is cooked)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DRIED YELLOW PEAS<|>EVENT<|>Dried yellow peas are used as an alternative to cornmeal to roll the Peameal Bacon in)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BRINE<|>EVENT<|>Brine is a mixture of water, maple syrup, salt, and spices that is used to cure the pork loin)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PRAGUE POWDER #1 CURE<|>EVENT<|>Prague powder #1 cure is an optional ingredient used in the brine to help preserve the meat)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEPPERCORNS<|>EVENT<|>Peppercorns are used in the brine to add flavor to the Peameal Bacon)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MUSTARD SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Mustard seeds are used in the brine to add flavor to the Peameal Bacon)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAY LEAF<|>EVENT<|>Bay leaf is used in the brine to add flavor to the Peameal Bacon)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC CONTAINER<|>EVENT<|>A plastic container is used to hold the brine and the meat during the curing process)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BRINE INJECTOR<|>EVENT<|>A brine injector is used to inject the brine into the pork loin)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRIDGE<|>EVENT<|>The fridge is used to store the Peameal Bacon during the curing process)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
