Cut the chicken breasts into 1 inch cubes. Place in a Ziploc bag and add the rest of the ingredients. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour.\n2. Turn your oven to broil and skewer the cubes on the chopsticks. If the chopsticks are not lacquered then place them in water for an hour before use, so they won't char in the oven.\n3. Grill the skewers in the top of your oven for about 12 minutes or until completely cooked through. Turn after half the time.\n1. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan. Add the anchovy fillets and stir them until they melt.\n2. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the rest of the ingredients. Salt and pepper to taste. Add more lemon juice if you want.\nThe skewers can be served both warm and cold.\nThe sauce tastes better the longer it gets to absorb the flavors, so it can easily be prepared the day before. The same goes for the marinated skewers. Prepare and marinate the day before and just grill before the guests arrive.\nIf you have access to a grill, then of course that adds to the flavor. Don't forget to soak nonlacquered skewers beforehand so that they don't catch fire.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH ANCHOVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream is a dish that combines chicken, tarragon, and anchovy cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TARRAGON<|>EVENT<|>Tarragon is a key ingredient in Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ANCHOVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Anchovy cream is a key component of Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Chicken is the main protein in Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>EVENT<|>Lemon juice is used in the marinade and sauce of Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in the marinade and sauce of Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>EVENT<|>Crème fraîche is used in the sauce of Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Parmesan cheese is used in the sauce of Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH ANCHOVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream can be served warm or cold)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH ANCHOVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream can be prepared ahead of time)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>TARRAGON<|>ANCHOVY CREAM<|>Tarragon and anchovy cream are key ingredients in Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH ANCHOVY CREAM<|>Chicken is the main protein in Tarragon Chicken with Anchovy Cream<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH ANCHO"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
