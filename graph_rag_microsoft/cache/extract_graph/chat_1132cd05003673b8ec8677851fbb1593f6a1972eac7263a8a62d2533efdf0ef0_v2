Place potatoes in a large saucepan; fill with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to simmer and cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 20 to 22 minutes. Drain and set aside. In a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate; let cool and break into small pieces. In same skillet, add turkey, salsa, chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt and black pepper. Cook, stirring to break meat into small crumbles, until turkey is browned, 6 to 7 minutes. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut off and discard 1/4 inch from the top of each. Scoop out flesh and place in a bowl; add milk to bowl and mash. Stir in turkey mixture, bacon and 1/3 cup cheddar; spoon evenly into potato skins. Top with remaining 1/3 cup cheddar. Coat a baking pan with cooking spray. Place stuffed potatoes on pan and bake until heated through, 15 to 17 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_1132cd05003673b8ec8677851fbb1593f6a1972eac7263a8a62d2533efdf0ef0_v2"}
