Line bottom of 8\" cake pan with parchment paper. Cut a 21x5\" strip of parchment, butter or oil parchment, and line sides of pan. Center the pan on a large piece of foil and fold foil up over the sides to prevent water from entering pan.\nPlace white chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and heat in microwave in 20-second intervals (or set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water), stirring occasionally, until melted. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in cream cheese. Let cool slightly, then add yolks and stir to combine.\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, whip egg whites in another large bowl until stiff peaks form. Add a small portion of egg whites to chocolate mixture and stir just until lightened. Gently fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions until just combined.\nPour batter into prepared pan. Place pan in a baking dish or roasting pan and add warm water to reach halfway up sides of cake pan. Bake cheesecake until set, 40–45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave pan in oven 15 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Remove cheesecake from pan, transfer to a platter, and chill until cold, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White chocolate is a type of chocolate used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cake pan is a kitchen tool used to bake cakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An oven is a kitchen appliance used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROWAVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A microwave is a kitchen appliance used for heating food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A saucepan is a kitchen tool used for heating food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING DISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A baking dish is a kitchen tool used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTING PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A roasting pan is a kitchen tool used for roasting food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wire rack is a kitchen tool used for cooling food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A platter is a kitchen tool used for serving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3-INGREDIENT JAPANESE CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>A 3-ingredient Japanese cheesecake is a type of dessert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>White chocolate and cream cheese are used together in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>CAKE PAN<|>Eggs are used in the recipe and a cake pan is used to bake the cheesecake<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>OVEN<|>A cake pan is used to bake the cheesecake in an oven<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROWAVE<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE<|>White chocolate is melted in a microwave"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
