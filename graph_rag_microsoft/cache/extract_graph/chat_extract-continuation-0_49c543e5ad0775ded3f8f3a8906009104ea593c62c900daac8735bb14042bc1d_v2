Place the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Leave the oven on.\nCombine the heavy cream and eggs in a bowl and whisk to thoroughly blend. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Soak the bread in the mixture for 15 minutes, then turn the slices over and soak for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.\nPlace a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the canola oil. Once the oil is hot (it will shimmer slightly), fry the challah slices on each side until golden brown, working in batches. Transfer the challah to a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake until the custard is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes; the bread should soufflé, or puff up. Remove from the oven, cover each slice with grated cheese, and return the pan to the oven to melt the cheese. Once the cheese is melted, about 4 minutes, remove from the oven. Put 2 slices bacon and 2 slices tomato on each slice of challah and drizzle with some of the vinaigrette. Toss the arugula with the remaining dressing (or enough to coat) and place atop each piece. Serve warm.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>EVENT<|>French Toast BLT with Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette is a dish that combines French toast with BLT ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTED GARLIC VINAIGRETTE<|>EVENT<|>Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette is a sauce used in the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKED BACON<|>EVENT<|>Smoked bacon is a key ingredient in the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is used to soak the bread in the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are used to soak the bread in the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHALLAH BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Challah bread is used as the base for the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRUYÈRE CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Gruyère cheese is used to top the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARUGULA<|>EVENT<|>Arugula is used as a garnish for the French Toast BLT dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTED GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Roasted garlic is used to make the Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette sauce)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>ROASTED GARLIC VINAIGRETTE<|>The French Toast BLT dish uses the Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette sauce<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>SMOKED BACON<|>The French Toast BLT dish uses smoked bacon as an ingredient<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>The French Toast BLT dish uses heavy cream to soak the bread<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>EGGS<|>The French Toast BLT dish uses eggs to soak the bread<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRENCH TOAST BLT<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
