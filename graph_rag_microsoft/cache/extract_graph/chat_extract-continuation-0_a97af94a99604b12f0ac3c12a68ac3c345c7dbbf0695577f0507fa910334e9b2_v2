This cut has a really good balance of fat and flavorsome meat. Divide it into 4 and, with wet hands, roll each piece into a ball, then press into flat patties roughly 5 inches wide and about 3/4 inch wider than your buns. Place on an oiled plate and chill in the fridge. Next, finely slice the red onion, then dress in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of sea salt. Slice the gherkins and halve the buns. Finely chop the lettuce and mix with the rest of the burger sauce ingredients in a bowl, then season to taste.\nI like to cook only 2 burgers at a time to achieve perfection, so get two pans on the go—a large non-stick frying pan on a high heat for your burgers and another on a medium heat for the bacon. Pat your burgers with oil and season them with salt and pepper. Put 2 burgers into the first pan, pressing down on them with a slotted spatula, then put half the bacon into the other pan. After 1 minute, flip the burgers and brush each cooked side with a 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a dash of Tabasco. After another minute, flip onto the mustard side and brush again with another 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a second dash of Tabasco on the other side. Cook for 1 more minute, by which point you can place some crispy bacon on top of each burger with a slice of cheese. Add a tiny splash of water to the pan and place a heatproof bowl over the burgers to melt\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>INSANITY BURGER<|>EVENT<|>Insanity Burger is a recipe for a burger with a balance of fat and flavorsome meat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHUCK STEAK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chuck steak is a cut of beef used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red onion is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE WINE VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White wine vinegar is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERKINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gherkins are an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME-TOPPED BRIOSCHE BURGER BUNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sesame-topped brioche burger buns are an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKED BACON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smoked bacon is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yellow mustard is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABASCO CHIPOTLE SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tabasco Chipotle sauce is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED LECHESTER CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red Leicester cheese is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO KETCHUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato ketchup is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICEBERG LETTUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Iceberg lettuce is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mayo is an ingredient used in the Insanity Burger recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
