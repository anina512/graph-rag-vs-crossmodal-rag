Return to room temperature before using.\nRoll out one disc of Magpie Dough for Flaky Piecrust into a 13-inch circle with an even thickness of 1/4 inch. Transfer dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim overhang to 1 inch all the way around. Cover the bottom crust with plastic wrap and put the pan in the refrigerator while you roll the dough to the top shell.\nRoll out the second disk of pie dough to a 13-inch circle with an even thickness of 1/4 inch. Transfer dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and using a pizza wheel, pastry cutter, or large knife, along with a ruler, cut dough into ten 1-inch-wide strips. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you work on the filling for the pie.\nPreheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) with a rack in the center. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nIn a large bowl, toss the peaches with the brown sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Let sit 5 minutes.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, ground tapioca, cinnamon, and salt. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the peaches and toss to combine. The mixture may look dry at first; let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the sugar and lemon juice to draw more of the juices out of the fruit, then give it another good tossing to mix well and moisten all of the sugar and tapioca granules.\nRetrieve the prepared crust from the refrigerator and set the pan on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Pour the filling into the bottom shell. Use your index finger to scrape some of the syrupy fruit juices off the sides of the mixing bowl and generously moisten the top edge of the shell.\nLay remaining dough strips on top of the pie in a lattice pattern, then roll and crimp the edges.\nWhisk the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water. Lightly brush the lattice with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the pie 25 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet, lower the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C), and bake 30 minutes more, or until the juices bubble up through the lattice. Tent the top with foil if the crust starts to over-brown.\nSet the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_21a1845e490e740ea0f333280b2105c018d8d03c357e654dbb3d7ed7f90813b9_v2"}
