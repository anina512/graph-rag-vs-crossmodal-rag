Split the vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds. In a small skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla bean seeds and salt. Let cool slightly.\nIn a food processor, blend graham crackers until finely ground. Add butter mixture and pulse until well combined. Press mixture into bottom and sides of pie pan. Bake until lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on a wire rack at least 30 minutes.\nReserve 1/2 cup blueberries for garnish, set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the orange juice, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and salt, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil and the sugar has dissolved. Add the remaining 5 1/2 cups blueberries. Stir in the cornstarch and bring to a low boil. Stir constantly, gently mashing the berries with the back of a spoon until broken down and thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and spoon into pie crust. If you have extra filling, save to enjoy over yogurt or ice cream. Let the filled pie cool for 15 minutes. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or up to 1 day.\nIn a large bowl, beat the cream to very soft peaks. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and vanilla extract into the cream and beat until soft peaks return. Do not over beat.
