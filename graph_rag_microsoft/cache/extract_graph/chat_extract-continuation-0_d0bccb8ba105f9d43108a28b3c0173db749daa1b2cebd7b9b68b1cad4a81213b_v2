Spread the crumbs on a baking sheet and toss them with the oil, garlic, herbs, and a pinch of salt until evenly coated. Roast the crumbs, tossing occasionally, until they’re golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Once cooled, the rye crisps can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.\nIn a mini food processor, pulse all of the ingredients together until they’re well combined and the dressing has emulsified. (You can also whisk the dressing by hand.)\nPlace the lettuce leaves in a large bowl and scatter them with the torn mint. Pour about 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the vinaigrette over the leaves, gently tossing until well coated, adding more dressing if needed. Transfer the salad to a platter and, using a fine grater, grate on additional cheese. Scatter with the rye crisps and remaining mint, and finish with freshly cracked pepper.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
