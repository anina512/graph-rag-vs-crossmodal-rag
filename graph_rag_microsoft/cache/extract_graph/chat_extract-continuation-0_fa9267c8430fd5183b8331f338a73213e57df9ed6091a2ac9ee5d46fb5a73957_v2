Stir cream and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until mixture starts to bubble; pour over chocolate and whisk until smooth. Keep warm. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm before using.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, combine flour and next 6 ingredients. Beat at low speed until dough forms. Gradually add butter, beating until absorbed between additions and occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. Increase speed to medium and beat until smooth and glossy, about 3 minutes. Scrape dough from paddle and sides of bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise for 2 hours. Pour enough oil into a deep, heavy 5-quart pot to reach a depth of 1 1/2\" Attach a deep-fry thermometer to side of pot and heat oil over medium heat until it reaches 325°F. Working in batches, drop dough into oil by heaping teaspoonfuls (about 1\"-diameter rounds). Cook, turning occasionally, until zeppole are golden and cooked, about 4 minutes per batch. Using a slotted spoon, transfer zeppole to paper towels; drain. Sift powdered sugar over zeppole or put sugar in a paper bag and add zeppole; shake gently to coat.

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a library like spaCy to perform entity recognition on the text. This will identify the entities in the text, such as organizations, people, and locations.\n\n2. **Entity Extraction**: Extract the relevant information from the entities, such as the entity name, type, and description.\n\n3. **Relationship Identification**: Use a library like NetworkX to identify the relationships between the entities. This can be done by analyzing the text and identifying the connections between the entities.\n\n4. **Relationship Scoring**: Assign a score to each relationship based on the strength of the connection. This can be done using a machine learning model or a simple heuristic.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**: Format the output as a list of entities and relationships, with each entity and relationship represented as a tuple.\n\nHere's some sample code to get you started:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom networkx.algorithms import community\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nZeppole with Chocolate Sauce\n\nIngredients:\n['8 ounces 70% bittersweet chocolate, chopped', '1 cup heavy whipping cream', '1/4 cup honey', '2 cups plus 1/2 tablespoon bread flour', '1/2 cup plus 1/2 tablespoon whole milk', '3 tablespoons sugar', '1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest', '3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast (from 1 envelope)', '3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt', '2 large eggs', '3/4 cup (1 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into cubes', 'Vegetable oil (for deep-frying)', 'Powdered sugar']\n\nInstructions:\nPut chocolate in a medium bowl.
