Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the potatoes are tender about 30 minutes. Drain and let stand until cool enough to handle. Peel the potatoes and place in a medium bowl. Mash the potatoes, leaving them a bit lumpy\n2. Make a lengthwise cut in each chile and remove the seeds. Combine the mashed potatoes, avocados, olive oil, and ground peppercorns in a medium bowl and season with the salt. Stuff the chiles with the potato mixture. Place in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.\n3. To roast the garlic: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring the garlic and milk to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, then boil for 3 minutes, taking care that the milk does not boil over. Drain the garlic in a sieve, discarding the milk. In a small bowl, toss the garlic cloves in the olive oil. Spread the garlic in a single layer on a baking sheet and cover with aluminum foil. Roast until tender and golden, about 20 minutes. Set aside.\n4. To make the marinade: Bring the water and piloncillo or brown sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3a96f888f1b49444a256e62fb5742793c517d821790c9d0aa5559d19690f7442_v2"}
