Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef custom_entity_recognizer(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Define the entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\"}\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n    \n    # Add the patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n    \n    # Process the document\n    doc = nlp(doc)\n    \n    # Find the entities\n    ents = []\n    for ent in matcher(doc):\n        ents.append(ent)\n    \n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Baked Snapper with Harissa, New Potatoes, and Spring Onions\"\n\n# Get the entities\nents = custom_entity_recognizer(text)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor ent in ents:\n    print(f\"({ent.label_}<|>{ent.text}<|>{ent.label_}<|>{ent.text})\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity disambiguation and relation extraction on the text.
