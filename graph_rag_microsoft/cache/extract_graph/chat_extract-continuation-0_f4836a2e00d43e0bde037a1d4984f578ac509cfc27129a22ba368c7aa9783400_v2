Clean and lightly oil grate. Grill peppers over hottest part of grill, turning occasionally, until skins are blackened and blistered all over, 15–20 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let cool.\nWhile the bell peppers cool, mix paprika, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl, then toss chicken pieces in spice mixture to coat. Arrange chicken pieces, skin side down, over hottest part of grill and grill, turning halfway through, until lightly charred, 5–10 minutes. Move chicken to cooler part of grill, cover with lid, and continue to grill, turning several times (keep covered), until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 160°F for breasts and 155°F for thighs and drumsticks, 15–25 minutes longer (the chicken temperature will increase about 5°F as it rests). Transfer chicken pieces to a rimmed baking sheet as they are done (smaller pieces will go more quickly) and let cool.\nRemove skins and seeds from bell peppers; discard. Tear flesh into about 2\"-wide strips. Toss in a clean large bowl with Master Vegetable Marinade and oregano and let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.\nToss chicken and marinated bell peppers (minus juices in bowl) together on a platter. Pour juices over chicken. Serve with Lemony Yogurt Sauce and/or Grilled Serrano Salsa Verde alongside.\nChicken can be grilled and bell peppers can be marinated 1 day ahead.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Entity Identification**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify entities in the text. We'll define a function `extract_entities` that takes the text and entity types as input and returns a list of entities.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n            entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n    return entities\n```\n\n**Step 2: Relationship Identification**\n\nWe'll define a function `extract_relationships` that takes the list of entities as input and returns a list of relationships.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            source_entity = entities[i][1]\n            target_entity = entities[j][1]\n            relationship_description = f\"{source_entity} is related to {target_entity}\"\n            relationship_strength = 1  # default strength\n            relationships.append((\"relationship\", source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    return relationships\n```\n\n**Step 3: Combine Entities and Relationships**\n\nWe'll define a function `combine_entities_and_relationships` that takes the list of entities and relationships as input and returns the combined list.\n\n```python\ndef combine_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships):\n    combined_list = entities + relationships\n    return combined_list\n```\n\n**Step 4: Format Output**\n\nWe'll define a function `format_output` that takes the combined list as input and returns the formatted output.\n\n```python\ndef format_output(combined_list):\n    output = \"\"\n    for item in combined_list:\n        if item[0] == \"entity\":\n            output += f\"({item[0]}<|>{item[1]}<|>{item[2]}<|>{item[3]})##\\n\"\n        elif item[0] == \"relationship\":\n            output += f\"({item[0]}<|>{item[1]}<|>{item[2]}<|>{"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
