Romano cheese']\n\nInstructions:\nGrind the peppercorns and mix with the salt and thyme leaves. Rub the beef lightly with some of the olive oil, then rub the pepper mixture all over the beef. Heat a ridged cast-iron grill pan until very hot. Put the beef in the pan and sear on all sides, then remove from the pan and let cool.\nUse a long, sharp knife to slice the beef as thinly as possible. Place the slices on a board and press them with the flat side of the knife blade to flatten each slice and make it bigger.\nCover the serving plates with the beef. Season, then drizzle with half the lemon juice. Toss the salad leaves and sprouts with some olive oil and a little more lemon juice. Scatter the leaves over the beef, then shave the cheese on top. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and serve with the lemon wedges.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SEARED BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH THYME<|>EVENT<|>Seared Beef Tenderloin with Thyme is a recipe that includes ingredients like black peppercorns, thyme, and Romano cheese)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPERCORNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black peppercorns are a type of spice used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thyme is a type of herb used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BEEF TENDERLOIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beef tenderloin is a type of meat used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Extra-virgin olive oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of fruit used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROMANO CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Romano cheese is a type of cheese used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON GRILL PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron grill pan is a type of cooking vessel used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Board is a type of surface used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Knife is a type of utensil used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is a person who may be interested in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is a person who may be interested in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is a person who may be interested in cooking)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SEARED BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH THYME<|>BLACK PEPPERCORNS<|>Seared Beef Tenderloin with Thyme includes black peppercorns as an ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SEARED BEEF TENDER"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
