Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the entity types specified in the problem statement.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef entity_recognizer(doc):\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        ents.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Coffee Crunch Bars\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['2 cups all purpose flour', '1/2 teaspoon baking powder', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1 cup (2 sticks) plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature', '1 1/4 cups (firmly packed) dark brown sugar', '2 tablespoons instant espresso powder', '1/2 teaspoon almond extract', '1 cup semisweet chocolate chips', '1/2 cup sliced almonds']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nPreheat oven to 325°F.
