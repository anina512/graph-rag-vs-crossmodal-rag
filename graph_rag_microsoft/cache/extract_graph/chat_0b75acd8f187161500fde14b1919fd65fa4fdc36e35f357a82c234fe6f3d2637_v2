Place the chicken in a large lock-top plastic bag. Add the yogurt mixture and turn the chicken to coat evenly. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours, turning occasionally.\n• Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place the potatoes in a roasting pan and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt over them. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place on a rack (a vertical roaster works well), and arrange in the pan on top of the potatoes. Pour the remaining reserved marinade over the potatoes and turn to coat them lightly.\n• Roast the chicken for about 30 minutes. Turn the potatoes so they cook evenly. Roast for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear when a thigh is pierced with a knife and the potatoes are crispy and cooked through.\n• Transfer the chicken to a carving board and let rest for a few minutes. Carve into pieces and arrange on a platter. Surround with the potatoes. Pour the juices from the pan over the chicken and potatoes. Garnish with parsley or watercress and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0b75acd8f187161500fde14b1919fd65fa4fdc36e35f357a82c234fe6f3d2637_v2"}
