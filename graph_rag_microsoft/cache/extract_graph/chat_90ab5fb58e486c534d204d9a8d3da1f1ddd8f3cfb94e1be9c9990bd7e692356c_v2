Let rest 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat 1 Tbsp. reserved garlic-oil mixture in a medium pot over medium-low until beginning to brown and smells fragrant, about 30 seconds. Cook shallot, bay leaves, and remaining 12 oz. mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add broth, bring to a simmer, and cook 30 minutes.\nStrain mushroom mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; wipe out pot. Cook flour and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in pot over medium heat, stirring constantly, until nutty brown and thickened, about 8 minutes.\nAdd wine, bring to a simmer, and cook 3 minutes. Add mushroom broth, 1 Tbsp. parsley, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper, and return to a simmer. Season to taste.\nPlace vegducken on a cutting board and cut into 1\" slices with a serrated knife, transferring to serving plates as you go. Spoon gravy over. Top with remaining 1/4 cup pepitas and 2 Tbsp. parsley.
