Add the ginger, green chile, turmeric, yogurt, salt, and citric acid. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, until the batter is very thick, 9 to 10 minutes. (It will resemble thick pastry cream or cream puff dough.)\nTurn the dough out onto the counter. Working quickly and using an offset spatula, spread it into a very thin (1/8-inch-thick) rectangular sheet roughly 24x20 inches. Use a paring knife to trim the rectangle to an 18-inch square. (Discard the trimmings or snack on them.) Then cut that square into four precise 9-inch squares. The dough cools and sets quickly so you will be able to peel each of the four squares off the counter easily as you need them.\nPreheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.\nPreheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with cooking spray.\nSpread one-fourth of the vegetable mixture evenly into bottom of the pan, pressing down lightly on it with the back of a spoon so it gets into the corners and is compact rather than loose.\nPosition one of the lasagna sheets over the vegetables so that it fits exactly in the pan. Repeat with the remaining three portions of vegetables and three lasagna sheets, ending with a lasagna sheet.\nCover the lasagna with a 9-inch square of parchment paper, then cover the dish with foil. Place is on a baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make (or reheat) the kadi sauce.\nTo serve, cut the lasagna into six rectangles. Serve in large pasta bowls with kadi sauce ladled over each portion.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COUNTER SPACE<|>GEO<|>A wide expanse of very clean counter space)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>GEO<|>A medium saucepan used to cook the batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is a type of root used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN CHILE<|>PERSON<|>Green chile is a type of pepper used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TURMERIC<|>PERSON<|>Turmeric is a type of spice used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>YOGURT<|>PERSON<|>Yogurt is a type of dairy product used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CITRIC ACID<|>PERSON<|>Citric acid is a type of preservative used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SILOXANE SPATULA<|>GEO<|>A type of spatula used to stir the batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>GEO<|>A type of spoon used to stir the batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>GEO<|>The batter cooked in the saucepan)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PASTRY CREAM<|>GEO<|>A type of dessert made with a similar batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CREAM PUFF DOUGH<|>GEO<|>A type of dessert made with a similar batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LASAGNA SHEETS<|>GEO<|>A type of pasta used in the lasagna)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE MIXTURE<|>GEO<|>A mixture of vegetables used in the lasagna)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING DISH<|>GEO<|>A 9-inch square baking dish used to cook the lasagna)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>A type of cooking appliance used to cook the lasagna)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COOKING SPRAY<|>GEO<|>A type of cooking spray used to grease the baking dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KADI SAUCE<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
