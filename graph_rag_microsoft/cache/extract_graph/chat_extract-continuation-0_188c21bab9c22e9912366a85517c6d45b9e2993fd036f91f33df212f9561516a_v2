Take two-thirds of the dough and pat it evenly into the springform pan, forming a 1-inch-/2.5cm-high rim at the edges. Refrigerate the remaining dough. Prick the dough in the pan evenly all over with a fork. Line the dough with a sheet of aluminum foil and fill the pan with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the crust is starting to firm up but is not yet browning. Remove from the oven and carefully remove the aluminum foil and pie weights; maintain the oven temperature.\nScrape the apple mixture evenly into the par-baked shell and smooth the top. The apple filling should precisely fill the crust. Roll out the remaining one-third of the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap until just slightly larger than the circumference of the pan. Trim the edges of the circle and then gently transfer the circle to the top of the cake, laying it over the apple filling. Tuck in the top crust and cut off any excess. Cut 3 small slits in the top of the dough. Put the pan back in the oven and bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and slightly puffed.\nRemove the pan from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes while you prepare the glaze. Sieve the confectioners’ sugar into a small bowl and whisk in the 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and the 2 teaspoons of water until smooth. Brush the glaze over the still-hot cake and then let the cake cool completely before serving. The cake will keep at room temperature, covered lightly with plastic wrap, for 2 to 3 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE CAKE<|>EVENT<|>The apple cake is a dessert that is baked in a springform pan with a crust made of dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGFORM PAN<|>GEO<|>A type of baking pan used to make the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE WEIGHTS<|>GEO<|>Used to weigh down the dough in the springform pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>GEO<|>Used to line the dough in the springform pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE MIXTURE<|>EVENT<|>The apple mixture is a filling for the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>EVENT<|>A liquid used to make the glaze for the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>A type of sugar used to make the glaze for the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>A liquid used to make the glaze for the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>A topping for the apple cake made from confectioners sugar, lemon juice, and water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>EVENT<|>A mixture of ingredients used to make the crust for the apple cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian who spent time in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Bratinas national and environmentalist who was held hostage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Aurelian journalist who was held hostage)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CAKE<|>SPRINGFORM PAN<|>The apple cake is baked in a springform pan<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CAKE<|>DOUGH<|>The apple cake has a crust made of dough<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CAKE<|>APPLE MIXTURE<|>The apple cake has an apple mixture as a filling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CAKE<|>GLAZE<|>The apple"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
