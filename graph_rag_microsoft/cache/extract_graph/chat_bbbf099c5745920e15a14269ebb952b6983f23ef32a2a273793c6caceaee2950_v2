We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relationships between these entities.\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform NER and extract the relationships:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nPapadzules\n\nIngredients:\n['2 1/2 cups (657ml) water', '2 large leafy stems of epazote', '1 scant teaspoon sea salt', '8 ounces (225g) hulled raw pumpkin seeds, about 1 2/3 cups (313ml)', '12 freshly made, warm corn tortillas, 5 to 5 1/2 inches (13-14cm) in diameter', '5 large hard-cooked eggs, shelled, roughly chopped, and salted', '1 cup (250ml) salsa', '2 large hard-cooked eggs, white and yolks separated and finely chopped', '12 epazote leaves (optional)']\n\nInstructions:\nHave ready a warmed, not hot, serving dish or warmed individual dishes.\nPut the water, epazote, and salt into a small pan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.\nSpread the pumpkin seeds in a thin layer over the bottom of a large skillet and heat through gently over low heat, turning them over from time to time. The seeds will swell, but take care not to let them become even slightly golden or the sauce will lose its fresh green color. You might want to keep a lid handy because often some of the seeds will start jumping out of the pan. Spread the seeds onto a metal tray to cool completely before grinding to avoid the blades seizing up with the volatile oil.\nUsing an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind a portion of the seeds at a time to a slightly textured consistency, 5 to 6 seconds.

Identify all entities.
