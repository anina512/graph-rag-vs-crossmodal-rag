Place oven rack in middle position. Put sugar in a round 9-by-3-inch cake pan. Using a heavy oven mitt or tongs, place the pan directly over medium heat to caramelize the sugar. Heat until the sugar liquefies, about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Do not touch the melted sugar — it will cause serious burns. When the hot liquid in the pan is a golden brown color, remove from heat and set aside on a rack to cool and harden.\nIn a blender, combine the almonds, condensed milk, whole milk, eggs, yolks, and vanilla. Process on medium speed until well blended. Pour custard mixture over the prepared caramel. Place the cake pan in a larger, deeper pan and pour about an inch of hot water around the cake pan to make a water bath. Cover the flan loosely with a foil tent and place the larger pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until flan is set in the center (it will no longer jiggle). Remove from the oven and cool on a rack at room temperature. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.\nTo serve, run a knife or thin spatula around the edge of the flan to release it from the sides of the pan. Place a 10-inch (or larger) serving platter on top of the pan. Turn the platter over and gently remove the cake pan, leaving flan on the serving platter. Using a flexible spatula, scrape up as much of the caramel as possible from the bottom of the pan and pour over the flan. Cut into triangular wedges and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>EAGLE BRAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eagle Brand is a well-known brand of sweetened condensed milk)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALMOND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Almonds are a key ingredient in the Almond Flan recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEXICAN VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mexican vanilla extract is a key ingredient in the Almond Flan recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>GEO<|>A round 9-by-3-inch cake pan is used to caramelize the sugar)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>The oven is preheated to 350 degrees to bake the flan)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>GEO<|>A wooden spoon is used to stir the sugar while it is caramelizing)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>GEO<|>A rack is used to cool and harden the caramelized sugar)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>GEO<|>A blender is used to combine the ingredients for the custard mixture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>GEO<|>The cake pan is used to bake the flan in a water bath)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLATTER<|>GEO<|>A 10-inch (or larger) serving platter is used to serve the flan)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>GEO<|>A flexible spatula is used to scrape up the caramel from the bottom of the pan)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>No information available about Samuel Namara)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>No information available about Durke Bataglani)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>No information available about Meggie Tazbah)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>EAGLE BRAND<|>ALMOND<|>Eagle Brand and Almonds are both key ingredients in the Almond Flan recipe<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>EAG"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
