Press the remaining half into tart pan, working it across bottom and up sides with floured hands to create an even layer. Chill the dough in the pan and the wrapped dough until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.\nScrape filling into crust and spread into an even layer. Unwrap remaining dough and roll out on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, to a 1/8\"-thick round. Cut dough into 8 strips. Arrange strips over top of tart in a crosshatch pattern (this dough is delicate,so don’t fuss with strips too much once they’re on the tart). Pinch off excess dough and press strips into edges to adhere. Chill 15–20 minutes.\nBeat remaining egg in a small bowl and brush over crust. Bake tart until crust is golden brown around the edges and golden across surface and filling is bubbling, 45–55 minutes. Let cool.\nJust before serving, remove ring from pan and dust tart with powdered sugar.\nFilling can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to a nonreactive container; cover and chill. Tart can be baked 1 day ahead.
