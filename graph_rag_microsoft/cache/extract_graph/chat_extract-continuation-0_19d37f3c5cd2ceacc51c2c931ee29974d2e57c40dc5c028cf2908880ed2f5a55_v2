Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.\nGenerously flour a rolling pin and work surface. Working with 1 disc at a time, roll dough to 1/4\" thick. Cut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutters (if dough becomes too soft, chill until firm). Place cookies 1/2\" apart on prepared baking sheets. Chill 15 minutes.\nBake cookies until edges are light golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.\nUsing small offset spatula, frost trees with icing. While still wet, decorate each cookie in 3 sections to create an ombre effect—start by covering bottom third with darkest green sanding sugar. Sprinkle the medium green shade in the center, then the light green shade over the top third. Tap cookie lightly to remove excess sprinkles. Top tips of trees with gold dragees to look like a tree topper. Let icing dry before storing cookies, about 3 hours.\nCookies can be made 10 days ahead; store in an airtight container at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>OMBRE CHRISTMAS TREE COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Ombre Christmas Tree Cookies is a recipe for cookies that are decorated to resemble Christmas trees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-IN-ONE SUGAR COOKIE DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-in-One Sugar Cookie Dough is a type of cookie dough used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE ROYAL ICING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White royal icing is a type of icing used in decorating cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDING SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sanding sugar is a type of sugar used in decorating cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD DRAGEES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gold dragees are small, round candies used in decorating cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE CUTTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cookie cutters are tools used in cutting out cookie shapes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFSET SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Offset spatula is a tool used in frosting cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JENNY<|>PERSON<|>Jenny is the author of the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3\"–5\" TREE COOKIE CUTTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>3\"–5\" tree cookie cutters are a type of cookie cutter used in cutting out tree shapes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>350°F<|>ORGANIZATION<|>350°F is the temperature at which the cookies are baked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10–12 MINUTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>10–12 minutes is the time it takes to bake the cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>15 MINUTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>15 minutes is the time it takes to chill the cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>3 HOURS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>3 hours is the time it takes for the icing to dry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>10 DAYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>10 days is the time it takes to make the cookies ahead of time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
