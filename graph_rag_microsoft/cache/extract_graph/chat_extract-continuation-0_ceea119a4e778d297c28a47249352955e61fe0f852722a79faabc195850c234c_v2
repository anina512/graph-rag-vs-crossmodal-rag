Blend on high. After the ingredients are blended, slowly add the oil and continue to blend until the mixture is thickened and emulsified. (Makes 1 cup.)\nHeat a grill pan to medium-high heat. Drizzle the watermelon slices with just enough oil to thinly coat and place them on the hot grill.\nGrill each side of the watermelon slices for about 2 minutes, until charred.

Roast for 6 to 10 minutes, until golden.\nBrush the cornbread cubes with the melted butter and place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Put in the oven along with the pumpkin seeds and bake for 10 minutes, turning halfway with a flexible spatula. Remove from the oven when the croutons are toasted and golden.\nToss the watermelon, shiso, dates, and chile in the bowl with ¼ cup Lime Mango Dressing (reserve remaining dressing for another use). Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Add the cornbread croutons and toss very gently to combine without breaking the croutons.
