Wet your hands with cold water and gently shape about 2 tablespoons of the mixture into a sphere by rolling it around in the palms of your hands. Try not to compact the ball too much. Note that the matzo balls will swell to more than double their size when cooked.\nAdd the rolled matzo balls to the boiling salted water and repeat with the remaining mixture. Bring the water back to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer, tightly cover the pot, and cook for about 40 minutes until the matzo balls are floating on the surface, puffed, and snowy white. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the matzo balls to the hot soup. Keep warm until you are ready to serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>EVENT<|>Matzo balls are a type of food that is cooked in boiling water and then served in a hot soup)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MATZO<|>EVENT<|>Matzo is a type of food that is used to make matzo balls)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALTED WATER<|>EVENT<|>Salting the water is a step in cooking matzo balls)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOILING WATER<|>EVENT<|>Boiling water is used to cook matzo balls)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SIMMER<|>EVENT<|>Simmering is a step in cooking matzo balls)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HOT SOUP<|>EVENT<|>Hot soup is a dish that matzo balls are served in)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>MATZO<|>Matzo balls are made from matzo<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>SALTED WATER<|>Matzo balls are cooked in salted water<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>BOILING WATER<|>Matzo balls are cooked in boiling water<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>SIMMER<|>Matzo balls are cooked by simmering<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO BALLS<|>HOT SOUP<|>Matzo balls are served in hot soup<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO<|>SALTED WATER<|>Matzo is used to make matzo balls that are cooked in salted water<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO<|>BOILING WATER<|>Matzo is used to make matzo balls that are cooked in boiling water<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO<|>SIMMER<|>Matzo is used to make matzo balls that are cooked by simmering<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MATZO<|>HOT SOUP<|>Matzo is used to make matzo balls that are served in hot soup<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SALTED WATER<|>BOILING WATER<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
