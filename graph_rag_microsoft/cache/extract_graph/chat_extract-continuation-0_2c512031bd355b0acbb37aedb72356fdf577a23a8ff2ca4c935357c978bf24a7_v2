Add 1 cup of a round-grain rice such as Arborio or Carnaroli and stir the rice over medium heat. Add the broth, one cup at a time, until the rice has absorbed 3 cups of liquid. You should stir the risotto frequently as it cooks to get a good creamy texture. (If you like, replace 1/2 cup of the broth with 1/2 cup dry white wine.) For a saffron risotto, add a few threads of crushed saffron with the first cup of broth.\nOnce the rice is tender and creamy, pull it off the heat and add 2 tablespoon butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese. Stir the risotto vigorously until the butter and cheese are blended in. Serve at once on heated plates.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RISOTTO<|>EVENT<|>Risotto is a type of Italian dish made from rice, typically served with butter and Parmesan cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARBORIO<|>EVENT<|>Arborio is a type of round-grain rice used to make risotto)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARNAROLI<|>EVENT<|>Carnaroli is a type of round-grain rice used to make risotto)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is used to make risotto creamy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Parmesan cheese is used to add flavor to risotto)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFFRON<|>EVENT<|>Saffron is used to add flavor and color to risotto)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISOTTO<|>ARBORIO<|>Risotto is made with Arborio rice<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISOTTO<|>CARNAROLI<|>Risotto is made with Carnaroli rice<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISOTTO<|>BUTTER<|>Risotto is made with butter<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISOTTO<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>Risotto is made with Parmesan cheese<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RISOTTO<|>SAFFRON<|>Risotto is made with saffron<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
