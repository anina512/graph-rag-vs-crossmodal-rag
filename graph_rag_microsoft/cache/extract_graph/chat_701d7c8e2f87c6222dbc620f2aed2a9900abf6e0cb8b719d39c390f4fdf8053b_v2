We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information for each entity.

Stir well and cook for 5 minutes.\nAdd the tomatoes, stir well, and cook for another 10 minutes, then add the fresh or cooked dried beans and coconut milk. Cook gently for 10 to 15 minutes (or until the beans are tender if cooking fresh).\nWhile the curry is cooking, wash the wild garlic very well, picking over each leaf thoroughly for they can carry little stones.\nA couple of minutes before serving the curry, add the wild garlic and cook until it is just wilted and soft. Don't overcook it—wild garlic should be bright and vibrant. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. This curry should be soft, fragrant, gently sweet, sharp, and salty, with just enough heat to warm you…\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_701d7c8e2f87c6222dbc620f2aed2a9900abf6e0cb8b719d39c390f4fdf8053b_v2"}
