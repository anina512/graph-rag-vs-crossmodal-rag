If you will be grilling the burgers, preheat a barbecue grill to medium-high.\n2. While the grill is heating up, cook the bacon on the stovetop in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it is just crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels and set it aside to drain. (If you prefer to panfry the burgers, reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the skillet.)\n3. Place the beef, Worcestershire, Tabasco, thyme, and salt and pepper in a bowl, and toss lightly with a fork to combine. Form the mixture into 4 patties, each about 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.\n4. When you are ready to grill the burgers, oil the grill grate well. Add the burgers and grill for about 3 minutes for rare, 4 minutes for medium-rare meat. Turn them over and grill for another 3 or 4 minutes, topping the burgers with the cheese in the last minute of cooking. (Or panfry the burgers in the hot bacon fat over medium heat for 3 minutes per side for rare meat, adding the cheese as described.)\n5. Place the burgers on the toasted buns, and top them with the bacon, tomato, onion, avocado, and lettuce. Cover with the tops of the buns and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>BACON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bacon is a type of cured meat commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWISS CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Swiss cheese is a type of cheese commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato is a type of fruit commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVOCADO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avocado is a type of fruit commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOSTON LETTUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston lettuce is a type of leafy green commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND BEEF CHUCK OR SIRLOIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ground beef chuck or sirloin is a type of meat commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Worcestershire sauce is a type of condiment commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABASCO SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tabasco sauce is a type of condiment commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil commonly used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAMBURGER BUNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hamburger buns are a type of bread commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red onion is a type of onion commonly used in burgers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not present in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not present in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not present in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia prison is not present in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
