Preheat the oven to 325°F. Butter a 10-inch glass baking dish.\n2. Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet and bake in the oven, turning once, until lightly toasted, about 15 minutes. Let cool.\n3. Combine the cream, milk, and vanilla bean and seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.\n4. Whisk together the yolks, sugar, maple syrup, and pumpkin puree in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the hot cream mixture until combined. Discard the vanilla bean and whisk in the bourbon.\n5. Scatter the pumpkin bread cubes in the prepared baking dish. Pour the custard over the bread, pressing down on the bread to totally submerge it in the custard. Let sit for 15 minutes to allow the bread to soak up some of the custard.\n6. Place the dish in a larger roasting pan and pour hot water into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the glass dish. Bake until the sides are slightly puffed and the center jiggles slightly, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and the water bath and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n7. Serve the warm bread pudding topped with whipped cream and drizzled with spicy caramel apple sauce . Sprinkle with pumpkin seeds if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING<|>EVENT<|>Pumpkin Bread Pudding is a dessert made with bread, pumpkin, and spices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICY CARAMEL APPLE SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce is a topping for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSLATED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is used to grease the pan for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Pumpkin Bread is a type of bread used in the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>EVENT<|>Whole milk is a key ingredient in the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla bean is used to add flavor to the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>EVENT<|>Egg yolks are used to enrich the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is used to add sweetness to the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Maple syrup is used to add flavor to the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNED PUMPKIN PUREE<|>EVENT<|>Canned pumpkin puree is used to add pumpkin flavor to the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon is used to add flavor to the custard for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESHLY WHIPPED CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Freshly whipped cream is used as a topping for the Pumpkin Bread Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHELLLED PUMPKIN SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Shelled pumpkin seeds"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
