Place 1 piece of butter in the bottom of each cup of a six-cup popover tin (or six 1/2-cup custard cups). Place the popover pan on a baking sheet.\nIn a smaller bowl, lightly whisk the eggs until they change color. Whisk in the milk.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt until well blended. Gently whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture until only small lumps are left, and set aside.\nPlace the popover tin and baking sheet in the oven for 4 minutes. At 3 minutes, give the batter a light whisk. Using an oven mitt, remove the hot tin from the oven and immediately divide the batter among the prepared cups. Bake for 25 minutes without opening the oven door. The popovers will be puffy, with crisp brown crusts and hollow, moist interiors. Serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Teatime Perfect Popovers is a recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POPVER PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The popover pan is a kitchen tool used to make popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The baking sheet is a kitchen tool used to make popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Milk is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>EGGS<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>MILK<|>Milk is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>FLOUR<|>Flour is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>SALT<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEATIME PERFECT POPOVERS<|>BUTTER<|>Butter is a key ingredient in the recipe for popovers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>MILK<|>Eggs and milk are mixed together in the recipe for popovers<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILK<|>FLOUR<|>Milk and flour are mixed together in the recipe"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
