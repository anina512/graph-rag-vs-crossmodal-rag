Make the croutons: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush both sides of bread slices with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cut into 1-inch cubes and bake croutons in oven on a baking sheet, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.\n2. Remove salmon skin from fillet and reserve fillet for another use. Lightly brush half tablespoon hazelnut oil on both sides of salmon skin and place on preheated grill until crispy, about 2 minutes per side. (Alternatively, you can crisp it under a broiler.) Pat salmon skin dry with paper towels, cut into three-quarter-inch dice, and set aside.\n3. Combine shallots, lemon juice, sherry vinegar, ginger, garlic, half cup of hazelnut oil, salt and pepper in a small saucepan and cook the dressing over moderate heat until shallots are wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes.\n4. In a large bowl toss the frisee, salmon skin, and croutons with warm sherry vinegar dressing. Divide among 6 plates and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FRENCH BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>French or Italian bread is a type of bread used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Italian bread is a type of bread used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmon fillet is a type of fish used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAZELNUT OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hazelnut oil is a type of oil used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shallots are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is a type of liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERRY VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sherry vinegar is a type of liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRISEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frisee is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISPY SALMON SKIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crispy salmon skin is a type of dish used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM SHERRY VINAIGRETTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warm sherry vinaigrette is a type of sauce used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISPY SALMON SKIN RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Crispy salmon skin recipe is a type of recipe used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM SHERRY VINAIGRETTE RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Warm sherry vinaigrette recipe is a type of recipe used in the recipe"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
