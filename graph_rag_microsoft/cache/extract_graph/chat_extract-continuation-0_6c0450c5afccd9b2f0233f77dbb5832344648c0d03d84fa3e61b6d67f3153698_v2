Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook until sauce is thick and reduced to about one-third, about 15 minutes. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)\nTo make the pineapple salsa: In a medium bowl, combine the pineapple, onion, jalapeños, bell pepper, cilantro, oil, and lime juice. Season with salt. (To make ahead, refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 8 hours.)\nTo make the jerk spice rub: In a small bowl, combine the garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, salt, nutmeg, chile powder, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper in a small bowl.\nUse a butter knife to pry the membrane off the bone side of the ribs. Once you get a piece of the membrane loose, grab it with a paper towel and pull it toward the other end of the slab to remove it. Rub the Jerk Spice Rub evenly over the ribs. Arrange the ribs in a 15-by-10-in/38-by-25-cm baking pan. Pour the Jerk Marinade over the ribs, turning to coat both sides. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\nRemove ribs from marinade, letting the excess drip off. Transfer the ribs to a baking sheet and allow to come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Brush with the Habanero Vinegar.\nTo cook ribs using a charcoal grill: Prepare grill for indirect cooking over medium heat. Place a shallow metal pan filled with water in the center of the grill and arrange the hot coals around it. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate directly above the water-filled pan, cover the grill, and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add coals as needed to maintain medium heat.\nTo cook ribs using a gas grill: Preheat the grill with all the burners on high. Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the ribs on the grate, turn off the burner directly under the ribs, and reduce the other burners to medium heat. Cover the grill and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\nAfter 45 minutes, brush the ribs with some of the Pineapple Glaze, and brush them two or three times before\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>JUICE AND BROWN SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Juice and brown sugar are used to make a sauce that is thick and reduced to about one-third)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Sauce is thick and reduced to about one-third)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PINEAPPLE SALSA<|>EVENT<|>Pineapple salsa is made by combining pineapple, onion, jalapeños, bell pepper, cilantro, oil, and lime juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JERK SPICE RUB<|>EVENT<|>Jerk spice rub is made by combining garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, salt, nutmeg, chile powder, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JERK MARINADE<|>EVENT<|>Jerk marinade is made by combining juice and brown sugar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HABANERO VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Habanero vinegar is used to brush the ribs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIBS<|>EVENT<|>Ribs are cooked using a charcoal grill or a gas grill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARCOAL GRILL<|>EVENT<|>Ribs are cooked using a charcoal grill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAS GRILL<|>EVENT<|>Ribs are cooked using a gas grill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PINEAPPLE GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>Pineapple glaze is used to brush the ribs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUICE AND BROWN SUGAR<|>SAUCE<|>Juice and brown sugar are used to make a sauce that is thick and reduced to about one-third<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PINEAPPLE SALSA<|>PINEAPPLE<|>Pineapple is used to make pineapple salsa<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JERK SPICE RUB<|>GARLIC POWDER<|>Jerk spice rub is made by combining garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, salt, nutmeg, chile powder, cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JERK SPICE RUB<|>ONION POWDER<|>Jerk spice rub is made"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
