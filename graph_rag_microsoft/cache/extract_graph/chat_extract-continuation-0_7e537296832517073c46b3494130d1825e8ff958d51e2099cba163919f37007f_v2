Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take the brisket out of the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking, to bring it to room temperature. After 30 minutes, season the meat with 2 tablespoons salt.\nPreheat the oven to 325°F.\nHeat a large, heavy-bottomed sauté pan over high heat for 2 minutes. Add the olive oil, and wait for 1 minute. Place the brisket in the pan (reserving the garlic and chiles). Sear the meat on both sides, about 8 minutes per side, until it's deep golden brown. You will need to sear a portion of the meat at a time, because the entire brisket probably won't fit in the pan. To do this, leave one end of the brisket hanging off the edge of the pan, and then move that end into the pan when the other part is well seared. Once both sides are well browned, transfer the brisket to a large roasting pan that has a tight-fitting lid, or a Dutch oven.\nReturn the brisket searing pan to the stove over medium-high heat, and add the onion, carrot, and celery. Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables just begin to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BEEF BRISKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beef Brisket is a cut of beef used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROMANO BEANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Romano Beans are a type of bean used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK OLIVE AÏOLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black Olive Aïoli is a condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>PERSON<|>Thyme is a herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAY LEAVES<|>PERSON<|>Bay leaves are a herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILES DE ÁRBOL<|>PERSON<|>Chiles de árbol are a type of pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Black pepper is a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Olive oil is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>PERSON<|>Onion is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROT<|>PERSON<|>Carrot is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>PERSON<|>Celery is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>PERSON<|>Balsamic vinegar is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED WINE<|>PERSON<|>Red wine is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEEF STOCK<|>PERSON<|>Beef stock is a ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROMANO BEANS RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Romano Beans recipe is a part of the Beef Brisket recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK OLIVE AÏOLI RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Black Olive Aïoli recipe is a part of the Beef Brisket recipe)\n##\n(\""}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
