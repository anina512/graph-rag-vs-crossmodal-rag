It is a very dry dough, and it cannot be overstated how important it is to generously and constantly spritz to help \"glue\" any loose flour to the dry dough ball. When the dough forms a stiff, solid mass, scrape away any dried clumps of flour from the work surface, which, if incorporated in the dough, will create dry spots in the final product.\nKneading is an essential step in the dough-making process: it realigns the protein structure of the dough so that it develops properly during the resting stage that follows. Kneading is simple: Drive the heel of your dominant hand into the dough. Push down and release, and then use your other hand to pick up and rotate the dough on itself 45 degrees. Drive the heel of your hand back in the dough, rotate, and repeat for 10 to 15 minutes. This is how Italian grandmas get their fat wrists.\nPasta is easy to underknead but virtually impossible to overknead (unlike bread, where each type has its sweet spot or ideal kneading time). That said, even though the dough cannot be overkneaded, it can spend too much time on the worktable–and, as a direct result, start to dehydrate and be more difficult to form into its final shape. For best results, I think a 10 to 15 minute range is a solid guideline. When the dough is ready, it will stop changing appearance and texture. The dough will be firm but bouncy to the touch and have a smooth, silky surface, almost like Play-Doh. Tightly wrap the dough in plastic wrap.\nAt this stage, the flour particles continue to absorb moisture, which further develops the gluten structure that allows pasta dough to stand up to rolling and shaping.\nIf you plan to use the dough immediately, let it rest at room temperature, wrapped in plastic, for at least 30 minutes prior to rolling it out (the next step). If resting for more than 6 hours, put the dough in the refrigerator. It's best to use fresh dough within 24 hours. Under proper refrigeration, the dough will hold for 2 days.\nRolling is the last phase of the mixing process. Rolling out pasta by machine–whether it's a hand-crank model or an electric one–should be a delicate, almost Zen-like art\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DRIED FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dried flour is a key ingredient in the dough-making process)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is essential for hydrating the dough and preventing dry spots)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH BALL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The dough ball is the main component of the dough-making process)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WORK SURFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The work surface is where the dough is mixed and kneaded)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KNEADING<|>EVENT<|>Kneading is an essential step in the dough-making process)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PROTEIN STRUCTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The protein structure of the dough is realigned during kneading)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RESTING STAGE<|>EVENT<|>The resting stage follows kneading and allows the dough to develop properly)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEEL OF THE HAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The heel of the hand is used to drive into the dough during kneading)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOMINANT HAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The dominant hand is used to drive into the dough during kneading)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROTATION<|>EVENT<|>Rotation is an essential part of the kneading process)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN GRANDMAS<|>PERSON<|>Italian grandmas are known for their kneading skills)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FAT WRISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fat wrists are a result of kneading pasta dough)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PASTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pasta is the final product of the dough-making process)\n## (\"entity\"<|>UNDERKNEADING<|>EVENT<|>Underkneading can result in a poor final product)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVERKNEADING<|>EVENT<|>Overkneading is virtually impossible with pasta dough)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DEHYDRATION<|>EVENT<|>Dehydration can occur if the dough spends too much time on the worktable)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pl"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
