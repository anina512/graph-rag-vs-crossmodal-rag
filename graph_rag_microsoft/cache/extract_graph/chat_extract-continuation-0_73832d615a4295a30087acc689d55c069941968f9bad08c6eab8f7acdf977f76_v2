Taste and season with more salt if needed. Remove beans from heat.\nToast a tortilla in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until golden brown in spots but not crunchy, about 2 minutes. Turn; toast on other side, another minute or so. Spread a thin layer of fat over one side of tortilla (about 1 tsp.). Spread 2 Tbsp. bean mixture over; sprinkle with one-quarter of 3 oz. queso fresco. Cook until edges of tortilla curl up a bit and beans are warmed through, about 2 minutes. Repeat process with 7 more tortillas.\nTop tortillas with rajas or chorizo and eggs and more queso fresco if desired. Serve with salsa.\nRoast poblanos over an open flame, rotating occasionally, until charred and blistered all over, 10–12 minutes. (Or broil on a rimmed baking sheet 8–10 minutes). Remove stems, skins, and seeds. Slice flesh into 1/2” strips.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onion and garlic and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent and softened, 10–12 minutes. Mix in chiles and oregano; taste and season with more salt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld and vegetables are very soft, 5–8 minutes. Keep warm until ready to serve.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook chorizo, using a spoon or heatproof spatula to break up any large pieces, until cooked through and starting to brown, 5–8 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.\nHeat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Sprinkle some salt onto the skillet. Crack eggs onto salt and immediately break yolks. Cook until underside is starting to brown, about 1 minute. Turn eggs and cook another 30 seconds (yolk won’t be entirely runny but shouldn’t be cooked through, either).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>BROWNED BITS<|>EVENT<|>Browned bits are a cooking technique used to enhance the flavor of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASTE<|>EVENT<|>Taste is a culinary technique used to adjust the flavor of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEASON<|>EVENT<|>Seasoning is a culinary technique used to add flavor to food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMOVE BEANS<|>EVENT<|>Removing beans from heat is a cooking technique used to stop the cooking process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOAST TORTILLA<|>EVENT<|>Toasting a tortilla is a cooking technique used to add crunch to the tortilla)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPREAD FAT<|>EVENT<|>Spreading fat over a tortilla is a cooking technique used to add flavor and moisture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPREAD BEAN MIXTURE<|>EVENT<|>Spreading a bean mixture over a tortilla is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOK TORTILLA<|>EVENT<|>Cooking a tortilla is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOP TORTILLA<|>EVENT<|>Topping a tortilla is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROAST POBLANOS<|>EVENT<|>Roasting poblanos is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAT OIL<|>EVENT<|>Heating oil is a cooking technique used to add flavor and moisture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOK ONION<|>EVENT<|>Cooking an onion is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIX CHILES<|>EVENT<|>Mixing chiles is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAT CHORIZO<|>EVENT<|>Heating chorizo is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAT EGG<|>EVENT<|>Heating an egg is a cooking technique used to add flavor and texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWNED BITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Browned bits are a cooking technique"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
