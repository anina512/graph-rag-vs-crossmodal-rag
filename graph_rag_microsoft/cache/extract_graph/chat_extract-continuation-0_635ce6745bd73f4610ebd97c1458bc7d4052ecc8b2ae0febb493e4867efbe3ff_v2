Once all the butter has been added, stir in vanilla and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Pour caramel into prepared springform pan and tilt to coat bottom. Let cool.\nStarting with slices from the neck, layer squash in an overlapping rosette pattern over caramel. Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar. Arrange remaining squash over first layer, placing pieces wherever needed to create an even thickness of squash across entire tart (this layer doesn’t need to be pretty since it won’t be visible). Sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar and chill while you roll out the puff pastry.\nLet pastry sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking and rotating a few times, to a round that’s a little over 11\". Using pan as a template, trim excess dough to make an 11\" round. Using a fork, prick pastry in 12–15 places. Drape pastry over squash and use a spoon to tuck edges in slightly between squash and sides of pan.\nBake tarte Tatin 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 45–50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in pan 10 minutes.\nIf using a springform pan, remove ring and carefully invert tarte Tatin onto rack (take care as some of the hot caramel could drip). If using a cake pan, set rack upside down over pan and invert tarte Tatin onto rack. Let cool 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk cream in a small bowl to soft peaks. Beat in powdered sugar and cinnamon.\nServe tarte Tatin warm topped with dollops of cinnamon whipped cream.\nTarte Tatin can be baked 10 hours ahead. Store loosely wrapped at room temperature. Reheat in a 250°F oven.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>butter is a type of dairy product used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vanilla is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>salt is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>caramel is a type of sweet sauce used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>squash is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>granulated sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUFF PASTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>puff pastry is a type of pastry dough used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TART TATIN<|>EVENT<|>Tarte Tatin is a type of dessert made with caramelized sugar and fruit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>wire rack is a type of kitchen tool used for cooling baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGFORM PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>springform pan is a type of baking pan used for making tarte Tatin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cake pan is a type of baking pan used for making tarte Tatin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cinnamon is a type of spice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cream is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWDERED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>powdered sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>VANILLA<|>butter and vanilla are used together in the recipe for tarte Tatin<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>SALT<|>butter and salt are used together in the recipe for t"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
