He looked\nout.\n\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in\nrestless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains\nlike Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were\nlinked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to\nScrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in\na white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who\ncried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an\ninfant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was\nclearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and\nhad lost the power for ever.\n\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he\ncould not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and\nthe night became as it had been when he walked home.\n\nScrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had\nentered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands,\nand the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but stopped at\nthe first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had undergone, or\nthe fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the\ndull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in\nneed of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep\nupon the instant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nSTAVE TWO\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS\n\n\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could\nscarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his\nchamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\nSo he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_384df6fb3c4ad7959df4c20dcee90839251f160c5aa53ccef61a847f67dfb57d_v2"}
