Toss dough to coat with flour and press gently to deflate. Line work surface with long sheet of parchment paper; sprinkle paper with flour. Roll out dough on prepared parchment to 16x14-inch rectangle. Using offset spatula, spread butter lengthwise in 5-inch-wide strip down center of dough. Sprinkle sugar, then nuts over butter. Cut unfilled dough on either side of filling into 3/4-inch-wide diagonal strips. Fold alternating strips over filling on slight diagonal, forming lattice top. Fold loose ends under bottom edge of bread. Slide parchment with bread onto large rimmed baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm draft-free area until very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPosition rack in top third of oven and preheat to 350°F. Brush bread with egg glaze. Bake until golden, turning sheet after 15 minutes, about 25 minutes total. Slide parchment with bread onto rack and cool at least 1 hour. Serve warm or at room temperature. (Can be made 1 day ahead.
