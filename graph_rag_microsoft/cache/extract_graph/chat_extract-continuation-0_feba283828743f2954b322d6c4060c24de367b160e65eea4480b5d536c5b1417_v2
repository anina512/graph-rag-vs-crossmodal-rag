Lay a second sheet of parchment paper on top and roll out the dough to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Remove the top sheet of parchment and, using a chef's knife, cut the dough into rough 2 by 4-inch rectangles. The dough will be sticky, so don't try to remove the rectangles until after chilling. Slide the parchment with the dough onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until the dough is firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 week.\nTo make the crackers, position racks in upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nUsing a small spatula, carefully remove the crackers and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart.\nBake, rotating the baking sheets midway through baking, until the crackers are golden brown and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, and then use a spatula to transfer the crackers to a wire rack to finish cooling.\nTo serve, spread a layer of ricotta cheese about 1/8 inch thick onto each cracker. Scatter a few edible flowers over the ricotta and sprinkle with sea salt.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parchment paper is a type of paper used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEF'S KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A chef's knife is a type of knife used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A baking sheet is a type of sheet used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An oven is a type of appliance used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICOTTA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ricotta cheese is a type of cheese used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDIBLE FLOWERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Edible flowers are a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEA SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sea salt is a type of salt used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wire rack is a type of rack used in cooking)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>CHEF'S KNIFE<|>Parchment paper is used with a chef's knife in cooking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>BAKING SHEET<|>Parchment paper is used on a baking sheet in baking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEF'S KNIFE<|>BAKING SHEET<|>A chef's knife is used on a baking sheet in baking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>OVEN<|>A baking sheet is used in an oven in baking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVEN<|>RICOTTA CHEESE<|>An oven is used to melt ricotta cheese in cooking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICOTTA CHEESE<|>EDIBLE FLOWERS<|>Ricotta cheese is paired with edible flowers in cooking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICOTTA CHEESE<|>SEA SALT<|>Ricotta cheese is paired with sea salt in cooking<|>6)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
