If using charcoal grill, light briquettes in chimney. Remove top grill rack. Place briquettes at left and right sides of bottom rack, leaving center empty (you may need to light additional briquettes in chimney to replenish during grilling time). Replace top grill rack. If using 3-burner gas grill, light burners on left and right, leaving center burner off. If using 2-burner gas grill, light burner on just 1 side.\nToast fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns in medium skillet over medium heat until fragrant and fennel seeds begin to darken, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour spices into spice grinder or small coffee mill; cool. Grind spices finely. Transfer to small bowl; mix in coarse salt.\nBrush turkey all over with oil. Sprinkle inside and out with spice mixture. Spread carrots, celery, parsnips, onion, and thyme in 13x9x2-inch metal roasting pan. Place turkey, breast side down, on vegetables.\nPlace pan with turkey on rack over unlit portion of grill. Cover grill. Insert stem of instant-read thermometer into hole in hood and maintain temperature as close as possible to 350°F by opening vents to increase temperature and closing\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_291c42ad967b56aabe3b915885313b3ce27bf089333d671befdad5dd2a3129e2_v2"}
