Once you have lifted enough to get a good grip, grasp the membrane with a paper towel and peel it off the rack (or ask your butcher to do this). Repeat with the remaining rack(s). Cut the rack(s) in half crosswise.\nStack the ribs in the Instant Pot. Pour in the apple juice and vinegar. Secure the lid and move the Pressure Release to Sealing. Select the Meat/Stew setting and set the cooking time for 20 minutes at high pressure. (For meat-falling-off-the-bone ribs, set the cooking time for 25 minutes.)\nLet the pressure release naturally for 15 minutes. While the pressure is releasing, preheat the oven to 400° F and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil or a silicone baking mat.\nWhen 15 minutes have passed, move the Pressure Release to Venting to release any remaining steam. Open the pot and, using a pair of tongs, transfer the ribs to the prepared sheet pan. Discard the cooking liquid.\nBrush the ribs on both sides with the barbecue sauce, then bake for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is a caramelized and browned. Remove from the oven, cut the ribs apart, and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c2ca91f41753a3c1c1de1074fca2b9501937e443519b5e2945896adf4a081121_v2"}
