Stir the yolks into the butter mixture until completely blended (no need to beat, and then stir the vanilla. Add half the dry ingredients and stir until mixed in. Stir in the milk until completely smooth, then the rest of the dry ingredients just until fully incorporated; set aside.\nUsing a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the egg whites until very fluffy. The whites should look shiny with soft peaks—stop whisking before they get dry looking. Gently but thoroughly fold the whipped whites into the batter—all the air that you just whipped in will go out of the whites if you over-mix at this point. Pour the batter over the fruit and gently smooth the top.\nPut the cake in the oven and start checking for doneness in 35 minutes: peek in, give the pan a tiny nudge, and look for jigglyness in the center. If it wobbles and looks soft and crinkled on top, gently close the door and set the timer for 5 more minutes. If it's looking set, slide the rack out and touch the top of the cake with your fingers, testing for bounce-back. If your touch leaves a dent that stays, return the cake to the oven. If it does spring back, the final test is sticking a toothpick into center of the cake. When it comes out moist, but crumb-free, it's done!\nLet the cake cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge, invert a plate on top of the pan, and carefully but quickly flip it over. Tap the bottom of the pan if the cake doesn't fall onto the plate on its own. Lift the pan away and replace any pear slices that may have stuck there.\nWhen ready to serve, combine all the ingredients for the whipped crème fraîche in a large bowl; whip until thick and fluffy, but still soft.\nSlice the cake and serve each wedge with a dollop of whipped crème fraîche.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>OBJECT<|>A medium-sized bowl is used for mixing the cake batter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>OBJECT<|>A stand mixer is used to beat the egg whites)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAND MIXER<|>OBJECT<|>A hand mixer is used to beat the egg whites)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>SUBSTANCE<|>Egg whites are beaten until fluffy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTER<|>SUBSTANCE<|>The cake batter is mixed and folded with the egg whites)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRUIT<|>SUBSTANCE<|>Fruit is added to the cake batter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE<|>SUBSTANCE<|>The cake is baked in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>OBJECT<|>The cake is baked in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>OBJECT<|>A toothpick is used to test the doneness of the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATE<|>OBJECT<|>A plate is used to invert the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNIFE<|>OBJECT<|>A knife is used to run around the edge of the cake pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAR SLICES<|>SUBSTANCE<|>Pear slices are used as a topping for the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>SUBSTANCE<|>Crème fraîche is whipped and used as a topping for the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEDGE<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A wedge of cake is served with a dollop of whipped crème fraîche)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOWL<|>STAND MIXER<|>The bowl is used to mix the cake batter, which is then beaten with a stand mixer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOWL<|>HAND MIXER<|>The bowl is used to mix the cake batter, which is then beaten with a hand mixer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>EGG WHITES<|>The stand mixer is used to beat the egg whites<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAND MIXER<|>EGG WHITES<|>The hand"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
