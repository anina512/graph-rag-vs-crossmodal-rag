Braise duck in oven 1 hour. Turn legs over; allow vegetables to fall into broth. Cover; braise until duck is tender and meat is falling from bones, about 1 hour longer. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Cover and chill. Rewarm in 350°F oven 20 minutes.\nPreheat broiler. Transfer 6 duck legs, skin-side up, to rimmed baking sheet. Tent with foil (cover and chill remaining 4 legs for leftovers). Transfer vegetables and olives from sauce to bowl; cover to keep warm. Spoon fat from sauce in roasting pan. Transfer remaining sauce to large skillet. Simmer sauce over medium-high heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and honey, if desired. Keep warm.\nMeanwhile, place duck legs under broiler until skin is crisp, about 4 minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef custom_entity_recognizer(doc):\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in [\"ORG\", \"PERSON\", \"GPE\", \"EVENT\"]:\n            yield ent\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Get the entities\nentities = [ent for ent in custom_entity_recognizer(doc)]\n\n# Format each entity as a string\nentity_strings = []\nfor ent in entities:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entity_string = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}>{entity_type}>{entity_description})\"\n    entity_strings.append(entity_string)\n\n# Print the entities\nprint(\"##\".join(entity_strings))\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities**\n\nWe'll use a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to identify relationships between entities.
