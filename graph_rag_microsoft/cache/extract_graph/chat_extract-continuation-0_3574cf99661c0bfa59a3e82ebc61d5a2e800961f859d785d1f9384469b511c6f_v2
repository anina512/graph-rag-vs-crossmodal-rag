Place ham in large roasting pan. Pour apple juice over ham. Cover ham completely with parchment paper, then cover ham and roasting pan completely with heavy-duty foil, sealing tightly at edges of pan. Bake ham until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of ham registers 145°F, about 3 hours 45 minutes. Remove ham from oven. Increase oven temperature to 375°F.\nRemove foil and parchment from ham. Drain and discard liquids from roasting pan. Cut off rind and all but 1/4-inch-thick layer of fat from ham and discard. Using long sharp knife, score fat in 1-inch-wide, 1/4-inch-deep diamond pattern. Spread mustard evenly over fat layer on ham. Pat brown sugar over mustard coating, pressing firmly to adhere. Drizzle honey evenly over. Bake until ham is well glazed, spooning any mustard and sugar glaze that slides into roasting pan back over ham, about 30 minutes. Transfer ham to serving platter; let cool at least 45 minutes. Slice ham and serve slightly warm or at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>OLD-FASHIONED HAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Old-Fashioned Ham is a type of ham with a brown sugar and mustard glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brown sugar is a type of sugar used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mustard is a type of condiment used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple juice is a type of liquid used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HONEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Honey is a type of sweetener used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SMOKED HAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smoked ham is a type of ham used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DIJON MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dijon mustard is a type of mustard used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE GRAIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole grain is a type of grain used in the mustard)\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE CIDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple cider is a type of liquid used in the glaze)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROASTING PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Roasting pan is a type of cooking vessel used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parchment paper is a type of cooking material used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEAVY-DUTY FOIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy-duty foil is a type of cooking material used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant-read thermometer is a type of cooking tool used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is not mentioned in the text)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE<|>PERSON<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
