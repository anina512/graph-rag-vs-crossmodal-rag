Place the hens on the sheet trays, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.\nPut the pan in the oven, and roast for 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F and the juices run clear.\nOne of the things I think people really don't know about me is that I was frying food before I was grilling! (Nowadays my love of fried food comes second only to my love of grilling.) Fried food in the South is like pizza in Chicago: if you grew up in Memphis, you grew up with it. My grandfather used to fry whole rabbits, and my grandmother used to fry chicken for breakfast, served up with biscuits!\n1 CHOOSE YOUR OIL Neutral oils like peanut, safflower, canola, and vegetable oil all have a high \"smoke point,\" so they work well at high frying temperatures. We often like to use peanut oil, because it adds a very subtle peanut flavor; the flavor of canola oil is less pronounced.\n2 PICK YOUR POT If you don't have an electric fryer, select a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven for deep-frying. You'll usually need at least 3 or 4 inches of oil in the bottom of the pan, but more if you're frying something larger, like Cornish game hens or chicken.\n3 FILL IT UP Be careful not to overfill your pot! If you don't leave room for the items you're frying, the oil may spill over the sides, causing a mess or, even worse, a fire. To check how much oil you need, you can first do a test run with water. Fill the pot up with water, then slip in the food you're going to try. Wherever the water rises to, that's how high your oil is going to go—so mark that place on the pot, and don't fill it too high!\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>MEMPHIS<|>GEO<|>Memphis is a city in the South where fried food is common)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>Chicago is a city where pizza is common)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEANUT OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peanut oil is a type of oil used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFFLOWER OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Safflower oil is a type of oil used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANOLA OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canola oil is a type of oil used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTCH OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dutch oven is a type of pot used for deep-frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC FRYER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric fryer is a type of appliance used for deep-frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSHRED GAME HENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornish game hens are a type of food that can be deep-fried)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken is a type of food that can be deep-fried)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILLING<|>EVENT<|>Grilling is a type of cooking method)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIED FOOD<|>EVENT<|>Fried food is a type of food that is cooked by deep-frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BISCUITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Biscuits are a type of food that can be served with fried chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rabbit is a type of food that can be deep-fried)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTERMILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buttermilk is a type of ingredient used in marinades)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
