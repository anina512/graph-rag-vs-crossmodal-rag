Butter soufflé dish; coat with 2 tablespoons sugar and set aside. Stir 2 tablespoons tangerine juice and cornstarch in a small bowl. Bring 1/2 cup tangerine juice, 3 tablespoons sugar, and zest to boil in a small saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add cornstarch mixture and whisk constantly until thickened, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl; whisk in lemon juice and remaining 2 tablespoons tangerine juice. Let tangerine mixture cool.\nMeanwhile, place egg whites with cream of tartar in another large bowl.
