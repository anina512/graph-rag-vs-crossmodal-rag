Stir sugar, 1/2 cup water, and cream of tartar in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup is pale amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush and swirling pan, about 5 minutes. Add nuts; stir with wooden spoon until coated with syrup. Continue to cook until syrup is deep amber color, gently pushing nuts into syrup, about 3 minutes longer. Immediately scrape mixture out onto prepared baking sheet, spreading as thinly as possible with metal spatula. Let praline stand until cool and firm, about 1 hour. Break praline into irregular pieces. Set aside a few pieces for garnish. Coarsely chop remaining praline. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.)\nWhisk yolks in bowl to blend. Bring cream, milk, and sugar to simmer in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Gradually whisk cream mixture into yolks; return to saucepan and stir constantly until mixture thickens slightly and instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers 170°F, about 3 minutes (do not boil). Transfer custard to 4-cup measuring cup; cool slightly.\nPlace white chocolate in medium metal bowl. Set bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water; stir just until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove bowl from over water. Gradually whisk warm custard into melted chocolate. Mix in vanilla. Cover and chill custard at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.\nProcess custard in ice cream maker. Transfer ice cream to container; cover and freeze at least 6 hours or overnight.\nLine 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with double layer of plastic wrap, leaving 4\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE PRALINE ICE CREAM TERRINE<|>EVENT<|>White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKBERRY-RASPBERRY SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Blackberry-Raspberry Sauce is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINDT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lindt is a high-quality white chocolate brand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERUGINA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Perugina is a high-quality white chocolate brand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White chocolate is a type of chocolate made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKBERRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blackberry is a type of fruit used in the Blackberry-Raspberry Sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Raspberry is a type of fruit used in the Blackberry-Raspberry Sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALNUTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walnuts are a type of nut used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg yolks are a type of ingredient used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy whipping cream is a type of ingredient used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole milk is a type of ingredient used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a type of ingredient used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of ingredient used in the White Chocolate Praline Ice Cream Terrine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM OF TARTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream of tartar is a type of ingredient used in the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
