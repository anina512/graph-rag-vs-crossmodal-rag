Melt the butter in a small pan, then remove from the heat and leave to cool a little. Grease eight holes of the friand (or muffin) tin with a little bit of butter.\nBlitz 85g (2/3 cup) of the pistachio nuts in a food processor with the confectioners' sugar until very finely chopped. Tip into a bowl with the ground almonds and flour and mix together. Roughly chop the remaining pistachio nuts and set aside.\nFroth the egg whites lightly with a fork, then pour into the nuts and flour mixture with the melted butter and mix well.\nPour the mixture into the friand tin holes, add a few raspberries to each one, then scatter with the chopped pistachios. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the friands are risen and springy to the touch and a skewer inserted comes out clean.\nServe warm or at room temperature. Dust with a little confectioners' sugar if you like. They should be light and chewy!\nPecan Pie Friands: Make the friand recipe above, swapping pistachios for 100g (1 cup) pecans and the raspberries for 75g (2.6 oz) chewy toffee, chopped into small pieces. Sprinkle the toffee over the friand batter before baking.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRY AND PISTACHIO FRIANDS<|>EVENT<|>Raspberry and Pistachio Friands is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRY AND PECAN PIE FRIANDS<|>EVENT<|>Raspberry and Pecan Pie Friands is a variation of the Raspberry and Pistachio Friands recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIO NUTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pistachio nuts are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Confectioners' sugar is a type of sugar used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND ALMONDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ground almonds are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg whites are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Raspberries are a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pecans are a type of nut used in the Pecan Pie Friands variation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEWY TOFFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chewy toffee is a type of candy used in the Pecan Pie Friands variation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD PROCESSOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Food processor is a type of kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUFFIN OR FRIAND TIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Muffin or friand tin is a type of kitchen appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
