Let rise for 1 hour.\nRepeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.\nWipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside.\nLightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of “cage” around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.\nSpace the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy.\nMeanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.\nWhen the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.\nWith firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across.\nThis next part happens fast\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>GEO<|>A container used for mixing and rising dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used to make bread)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>COUNTER<|>GEO<|>A surface used for rolling and shaping dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BENCH SCRAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used to cut and shape dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHAPED DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough that has been shaped into a specific form)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>GEO<|>A flat surface used for baking bread)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A material used to cover and protect dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device used for baking bread)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING STONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A flat surface used for baking bread in an oven)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WORK SURFACE<|>GEO<|>A surface used for shaping and rolling dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROLLING PIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tool used to roll and shape dough)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BOWL<|>DOUGH<|>The bowl is used to mix and rise the dough<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>COUNTER<|>The dough is rolled and shaped on the counter<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>BENCH SCRAPER<|>The dough is cut and shaped with a bench scraper<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>SHAPED DOUGH<|>The dough is shaped into a specific form<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SHAPED DOUGH<|>BAKING SHEET<|>The shaped dough is placed on a baking sheet<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>The baking sheet is covered with plastic wrap<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAK"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
