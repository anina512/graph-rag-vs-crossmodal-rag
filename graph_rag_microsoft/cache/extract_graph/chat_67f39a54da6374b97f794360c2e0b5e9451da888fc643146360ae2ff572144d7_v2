We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relationships between these entities.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform NER and extract the relationships:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nPeach Lattice Pie with Bourbon Caramel\n\nIngredients:\n['2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar', '3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter', '1 1/4 cups (295 g) heavy cream, at room temperature', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '3 teaspoons vanilla extract', '2 tablespoons bourbon', '1 recipe Magpie Dough for Flaky Piecrust, chilled overnight', '2 pounds (907 g) ripe peaches, each peeled, halved, pitted, and cut into 8 wedges', '1/2 cup (96 g) packed light brown sugar', '1 tablespoon vanilla extract', '1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1/2 cup (96 g) granulated sugar', '3 tablespoons finely ground instant tapioca (ground using a spice grinder)', '1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1/8 teaspoon fine salt', '1 large egg yolk', '2 tablespoons sanding sugar or coarse raw sugar, for sprinkling']\n\nInstructions:\nPour the sugar into a medium high-sided saucepan, tilting the pan to distribute the sugar evenly across the bottom of the pan. Set the pan over medium-high heat. Use a rubber spatula to occasionally push the sugar from the outer edge of the pan toward the center. The sugar will clump up slightly, but just keep pushing it around a bit; it will eventually smooth out. When the sugar is dissolved and darkened to the color of a copper penny (about 5 to 7 minutes), add the butter and whisk until incorporated.
