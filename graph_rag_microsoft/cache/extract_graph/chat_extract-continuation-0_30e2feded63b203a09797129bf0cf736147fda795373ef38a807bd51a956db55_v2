Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel to drain. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet if necessary. Add leeks and sauté over medium heat until tender, about 6 minutes. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid.\nWhisk eggs and 1/2 cup Parmesan in medium bowl to blend; gradually whisk in 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add pasta to leeks in skillet and stir to heat. Remove skillet from heat. Pour egg mixture over pasta and stir until sauce is just creamy and eggs are no longer raw, about 2 minutes. (Return skillet to very low heat if egg mixture is runny; do not overcook or eggs will curdle.) Add some of remaining 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid to pasta if needed to moisten. Stir in bacon and parsley. Serve pasta, passing additional cheese separately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>ORRECHIETTE CARBONARA<|>EVENT<|>Orrechiette Carbonara is a recipe for a dish that combines pasta, bacon, leeks, eggs, and Parmesan cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLEWOOD-SMOKED BACON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Applewood-smoked bacon is a type of cured meat produced by a company that smokes the bacon with applewood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORECCHIETTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orecchiette is a type of pasta produced by a company that manufactures pasta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese produced by a company that manufactures cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN PARSLEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Italian parsley is a type of herb produced by a company that cultivates herbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEEK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leek is a type of vegetable produced by a company that cultivates vegetables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is a type of food produced by a company that raises chickens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is a person who is cooking the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is a person who is cooking the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is a person who is cooking the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is a location where the ingredients for the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe are sourced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is a location where the ingredients for the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe are sourced)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is a location where the ingredients for the Orrechiette Carbonara recipe are sourced)\n##\n(\""}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
