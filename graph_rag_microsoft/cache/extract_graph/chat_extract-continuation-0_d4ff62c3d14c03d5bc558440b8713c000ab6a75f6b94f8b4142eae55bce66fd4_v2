Leave 1 inch of dough hanging over the edge, trimming any excess dough. Tuck the dough under itself, and then crimp the edge as desired. Chill at least 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, reserve 1 cup whole pecans to decorate top of pie; chop remaining 2 cups.\nIn a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter and cook until foam has subsided and butter is toasty-brown in color and releases a nutty aroma.\nPour butter into a large bowl. Whisk in sugar, syrup, salt, vanilla, rum, and espresso powder until all ingredients are well incorporated. Whisk in eggs, then fold in chopped pecans.\nPour filling into pie shell (do not overfill). Toss whole pecans with remaining 2 tablespoons cane syrup and arrange on top of pie. Place on preheated rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack of oven. After 20 minutes, rotate baking sheet and move to center rack of oven. Bake until crust is golden brown and filling is almost set with a slight jiggle in center of pie, 20 to 25 minutes more. (Cover the crust edge with foil or a pie shield if it starts to brown too much.) Transfer pie to a wire rack and cool completely before slicing, about 3 hours. Pie will keep up to 2 days, loosely covered with foil, at room temperature.\nDO AHEAD: The pie dough can be made up to 3 days in advance and chilled, or frozen for up to 3 months; thaw before using. The filling can be made up to 1 day ahead; bring to room temperature before baking.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PIE<|>EVENT<|>Pie is a type of baked dessert made with a pastry crust and a filling made from sugar, syrup, eggs, and nuts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE SHELL<|>EVENT<|>Pie shell is a pastry crust used to hold the filling of a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>EVENT<|>Pecans are a type of nut used to decorate the top of a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is a type of fat used to make a pie crust and to add flavor to the filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used to make a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Syrup is a type of sweetener used to make a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used to make a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUM<|>EVENT<|>Rum is a type of liquor used to add flavor to a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESPRESSO POWDER<|>EVENT<|>Espresso powder is a type of ingredient used to add flavor to a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla is a type of flavoring used to add flavor to a pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANE SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Cane syrup is a type of sweetener used to decorate the top of a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance used to bake a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>EVENT<|>Wire rack is a type of cooling device used to cool a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE DOUGH<|>EVENT<|>Pie dough is a type of pastry used to make a pie crust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILLING<|>EVENT<|>Filling is a type of mixture used to fill a pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRUST<|>EVENT<|>Crust is a type of pastry used"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
