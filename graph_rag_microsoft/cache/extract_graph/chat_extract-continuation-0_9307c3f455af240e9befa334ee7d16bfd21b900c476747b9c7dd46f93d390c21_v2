Remove the loin from the brine and lightly pat dry with paper towels.\nSprinkle the rub evenly on all sides.\nUsing your hands or a brush, evenly, but lightly, coat the loin with canola oil.\nInsert a remove thermometer into the center of the meat.\n5. Place the loin in the cooker and cook until the internal temperature reaches 135°F, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n6. Give the glaze a quick shake to reincorporate any ingredients that may have settled. Brush the loin with the glaze and return to the cooker until the internal temperature reaches 145°F, about 15 minutes. At this point the meat will be slightly pink in the center; cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes for more well-done.\n7. Pour about half of the remaining glaze on a cutting board and top with the loin. Let rest for 10 minutes.\n8. Slice the meat into 1/4-inch slices. Dredge the slices in the glaze, adding additional as needed to coat the exposed sides.
