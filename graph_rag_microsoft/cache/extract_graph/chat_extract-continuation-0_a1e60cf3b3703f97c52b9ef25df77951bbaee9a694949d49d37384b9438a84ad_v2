Add asparagus and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes.

Reserve 1 cup broth mixture for ragout and keep remaining broth at a bare simmer.\nCook onion in oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Add wine and simmer briskly, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup hot broth mixture and simmer briskly, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed.
