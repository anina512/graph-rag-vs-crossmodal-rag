Set aside 3/4 cup for dipping sauce. Using the coarse grater disk on a food processor or the largest holes on a box grater, coarsely shred carrots and celery root.

Heat oil over medium-high until shimmering, hot, and an instant-read thermometer registers 350°F.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entities and their corresponding information.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    \n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n            \n            entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n    \n    return entities\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all relationships among the identified entities\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between entities. We'll use a simple approach to identify relationships based on proximity and context.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    \n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            source_entity = entities[i][1]\n            target_entity = entities[j][1]\n            \n            # Check if the entities are related based on proximity and context\n            if source_entity in target_entity or target_entity in source_entity:\n                relationship_description = f\"{source_entity} and {target_entity} are related\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n                \n                relationships.append((\"relationship\", source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    \n    return relationships\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine the entities and relationships into a single list\n\nWe'll define a function to combine the entities and relationships into a single list.\n\n```python\ndef combine_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships):\n    combined_list = []\n    \n    for entity in entities:\n        combined_list.append(entity)\n    \n    for relationship in relationships:\n        combined_list.append(relationship)\n    \n    return combined_list\n```\n\n### Step 4: Format the output as a list of entities and relationships\n\nWe'll define a function to format the output as a list of entities and relationships.\n\n```python\ndef format_output(combined_list):\n    output = []\n    \n    for item in combined_list:\n        if item[0] == \"entity\":\n            output.append(f\"({item[0"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
