Cut apples as close to core as possible into three lobes; set aside. Scatter half of sugar in a heavy 9\" skillet and scrape in vanilla seeds; discard pod. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar is melted and starting to caramelize, 6–8 minutes (if using a cast-iron skillet, test the color of the caramel by spooning some onto a white plate. It should be pale amber). Add remaining sugar and cook until all sugar is dissolved and has taken on a deep amber color.\nStir in butter, vinegar, and salt. Place apples cut side down in skillet and cook until they start giving up some of their juices and shrink slightly, 5–8 minutes. Carefully turn apples over and scoot them together so they overlap slightly. (The apples will shrink more as they bake, so they need to be tightly packed from the beginning.) Remove from heat. Gently roll out puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface just to smooth out creases; cut into a round that will fit snugly and flush inside skillet. Drape puff pastry over apples and transfer skillet to oven.\nBake until pastry is puffed and starting to brown in spots, 20–25 minutes. Reduce heat to 350° and bake until apples are tender and pastry is golden brown and cooked all the way through, 20–25 minutes longer. Let rest 5 minutes before inverting onto a platter.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN TART TATIN<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin is a dessert recipe that involves cooking apples in a skillet with sugar and vanilla bean, then topping with puff pastry and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla bean is a key ingredient in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>EVENT<|>Apples are a key ingredient in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PINK LADY APPLES<|>EVENT<|>Pink Lady apples are a type of apple used in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is used to caramelize in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE CIDER VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Apple cider vinegar is used in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUFF PASTRY<|>EVENT<|>Puff pastry is used to top the apples in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROZEN PUFF PASTRY<|>EVENT<|>Frozen puff pastry is used in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>All-purpose flour is used to dust the surface for rolling out the puff pastry)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BEAN TART TATIN<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>Vanilla bean is a key ingredient in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BEAN TART TATIN<|>APPLES<|>Apples are a key ingredient in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BEAN TART TATIN<|>PINK LADY APPLES<|>Pink Lady apples are a type of apple used in the Vanilla Bean Tarte Tatin recipe<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
