Add chopped cilantro, onion, garlic, ginger, ground chile, ¼ tsp. salt, and reserved ground cubeb pepper. Blend mixture to a smooth paste.\nCoat fillets all over with marinade, rubbing into score marks. Place fish, skin side down, in a single layer in a large baking dish. Squeeze juice from half a lemon over. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Cover with plastic wrap or a lid and chill at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.\nFill a large bowl with water. Peel yams and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half crosswise. Cut each quarter into ½\"-thick slabs. (Length of slabs will depend on yam’s size, but you’re going for something that looks like steak fries.) Add yam slices to bowl as you work to prevent oxidation. When all yams are cut, swish in water to remove excess starch, then drain. Refill bowl and repeat process until water is clear, about 2 more times. Add sugar and ½ tsp. salt and stir until dissolved; add the drained chips. (Yams, like many foods that are good for you, can be quite bitter; the sugar will help counter this.) Let soak 30 minutes.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. Drain chips and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil. Season with black pepper, then sprinkle with chili powder and remaining 1 tsp. salt. Toss to coat, then spread out into an even layer. Roast chips, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.\nHeat broiler. Scrape off excess marinade from fish and place fillets, skin side up, on another rimmed baking sheet. Broil until browned and crisp on top and cooked through, 5–7 minutes.\nUsing a vegetable peeler, shave reserved papaya into ribbons, pick leaves from reserved cilantro stems, and cut reserved lemon half into wedges.\nTransfer fish to plates and top with papaya and cilantro. Mound yam chips next to fillets.
