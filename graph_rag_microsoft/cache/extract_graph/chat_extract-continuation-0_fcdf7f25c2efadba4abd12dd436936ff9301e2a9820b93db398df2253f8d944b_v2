Beat in the eggs and vanilla until ﬂuffy, about 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.\nTurn the mixer speed to low and add the ﬂour mixture approximately a quarter at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Reserve 1/4 cup of the chocolate-covered pretzels. Mix the remaining pretzels into the cookie dough until fully incorporated. The dough will form a ball around the paddle attachment and feel soft but not sticky.\nWrap the dough ball in a piece of plastic wrap and press down to form a 1-inch thick disk. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, or store for up to 7 days tightly wrapped.\nPreheat the oven to 375°F.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly ﬂoured ﬂat work surface to about 1/4-inch thickness, using additional ﬂour as necessary to prevent sticking. Use cookie cutters to create the shapes you want, and carefully transfer with a metal spatula to a nonstick baking sheet, placing the cookies about 3/4 inch apart.\nBake one sheet at a time on the middle rack about 7 to 8 minutes, until puffy. Let the cookies rest for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.\nMelt the candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl on 30 percent power for 30-second increments until melted.\nUsing a honey dipper, drizzle the chocolate over the cookies and sprinkle with the reserved chocolate-covered pretzels.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
