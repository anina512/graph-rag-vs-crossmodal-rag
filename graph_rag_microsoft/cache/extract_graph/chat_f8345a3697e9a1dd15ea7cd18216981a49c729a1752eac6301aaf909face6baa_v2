Place potatoes in a large wide heavy pot. Add 1 1/2 tsp. salt and enough cold water to cover by 2\". Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes break apart when pierced with the tip of a knife, 35–40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, cook garlic, cream, and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until butter is melted. Whisk in nutmeg, pepper, and 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. salt. Remove from heat.\nDrain potatoes and immediately pass through potato ricer into a large bowl. Stir in cream mixture until smooth.\nReturn half of potato mixture to wide pot; reserve remaining potato mixture in bowl. Add Gruyère and mozzarella and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until cheese is melted and mixture can be stretched with the spoon (like warm mozzarella), about 10 minutes. Transfer to gratin dish; smooth top.\nWorking in batches if needed, spoon reserved potato mixture in bowl into pastry bag fitted with star tip. Pipe very tight rows of 1/2x1/2\" rosettes on potato-cheese mixture in gratin dish. Bake until top is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f8345a3697e9a1dd15ea7cd18216981a49c729a1752eac6301aaf909face6baa_v2"}
