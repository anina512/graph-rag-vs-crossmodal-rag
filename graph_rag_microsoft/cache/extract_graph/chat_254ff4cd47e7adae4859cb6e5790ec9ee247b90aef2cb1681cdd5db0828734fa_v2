Pour eggs into a bowl, reserving shells.\nUse a knife to tear any membrane remaining in bottom of eggshells. Generously cover shells with cold water in a 3-qt saucepan and add vinegar. Simmer over medium heat, gently stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam, 15 minutes. Carefully transfer shells with a slotted spoon to a rack to cool. Gently wipe shells inside and out with a damp paper towel to clean completely. 3Put eggshells in eggcups or small glasses to keep them upright.\nBeat cream with a whisk until it just holds stiff peaks, then beat in lemon juice, vodka, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne.\nLightly beat eggs with a fork, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and remaining pinch of cayenne. Melt remaining tsp butter in nonstick skillet over medium heat, then cook egg mixture, stirring constantly, until eggs are just scrambled, 3 to 5 minutes.
