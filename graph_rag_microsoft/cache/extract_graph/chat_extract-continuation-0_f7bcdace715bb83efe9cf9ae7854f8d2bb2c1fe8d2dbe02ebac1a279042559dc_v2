Pour the fruit liqueur into a shallow dish. Sprinkle the pepper on a saucer. Dip the cut sides of the figs first into the fruit liqueur, then into the pepper, and place, cut side up, on a baking sheet to marinate for 20 minutes.\n2. Cut each slice of pancetta lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips. Loosely wrap each fig half with a strip of pancetta. Fry the rest of the pancetta until crisp and crumbly and set aside.\n3. Prepare a hot fire in your grill.\n4. Place the planks on the grill grate and close the lid. When the planks start to smoke and pop, after 3 to 5 minutes, open the lid and turn the planks over using grill tongs. Quickly place the fig halves on the planks, cut side up. Sprinkle the goat cheese and fried pancetta on the figs. Cover and plank-roast for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the figs have softened and are scorched around the edges and the goat cheese has a burnished appearance and a brownish-red color. Drizzle with the honey and serve.\nOven-Planking: Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the planked pancetta-wrapped figs, sprinkled with goat cheese and fried pancetta, in the middle of the oven. Plank-roast for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the figs are scorched around the edges. Drizzle with honey and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PLANKED FIGS<|>EVENT<|>Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese is a recipe for a dish made with figs, pancetta, and goat cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLANKS<|>GEO<|>Planks are used in the recipe to grill the figs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME DE MÛRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crème de mûre is a type of fruit liqueur used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALVADOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Calvados is a type of fruit liqueur used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH FIGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fresh figs are a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANCETTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pancetta is a type of cured meat used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOAT CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Goat cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOVER HONEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clover honey is a type of honey used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANKED FIGS<|>PLANKS<|>Planks are used to grill the figs in the Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANKED FIGS<|>CRÈME DE MÛRE<|>Crème de mûre is a type of fruit liqueur used in the Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANKED FIGS<|>CALVADOS<|>Calvados is a type of fruit liqueur used in the Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANKED FIGS<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>Black pepper is a spice used in the Planked Figs with Pancetta and Goat Cheese recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANKED FIG"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
