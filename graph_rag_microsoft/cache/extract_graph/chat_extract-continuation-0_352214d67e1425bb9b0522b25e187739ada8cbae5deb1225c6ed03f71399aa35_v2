Season with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: The enchilada sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 3 days, or frozen, up to 3 months.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F and butter 2 (9- by 13-inch) baking dishes. Spread about 1 cup of the enchilada sauce in the bottom of each dish.\nPick the meat off the leftover turkey carcass and transfer to a large bowl—you'll need about 4 cups of meat. Add half the remaining enchilada sauce, along with half the queso fresco and half the queso Chihuahua, and stir to combine.\nOn a work surface, spread about 1 cup of the turkey filling on the bottom half of 1 tortilla and roll it up burrito-style, folding in the sides to seal them closed. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling. Arrange the enchiladas tightly in the 2 prepared baking dishes then cover with the remaining sauce, followed by the remaining queso fresco and queso Chihuahua. DO AHEAD: The turkey enchiladas can be assembled up to this point, covered, and refrigerated, up to 24 hours, or frozen up to 3 months.\nCover the enchiladas with foil and bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is thickened and dark, about 1 hour.
