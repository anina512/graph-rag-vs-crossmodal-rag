Combine the butter and 1/2 cup of the miso in a medium bowl and mash them together to make a uniform mixture. Put the potatoes into the bottom of the slow cooker and add a small dollop of the miso butter; stir to coat. Season the potatoes lightly with salt. Pat the chicken dry and rub the remaining butter all over the chicken, and especially under the skin of the breasts directly on the breast meat: To do this, gently loosen the skin and separate it from the breast meat by sliding your fingers under the skin, then tuck some butter in there. Set the chicken on top of the potatoes.\nCover the slow cooker and reduce the heat to LOW. Cook for 5 to 6 hours (the larger the slow cooker, the shorter the cook time), until the chicken breast registers 160°F internal temperature on an instant-read or probe thermometer when you check the top of the breast. Also check that the thickest part of the thigh and the juice in the cavity register at least 165°F. Cooking the chicken much beyond these temperatures will result in dry meat, so this is a case when pulling out the thermometer really makes a difference.\nTurn off and uncover the slow cooker and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the broiler on high and position a rack 6 inches from the heat source (if that’s how your broiler works). Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. In a small bowl mix together the honey and remaining 1/4 cup miso.\nUsing tongs slung through the cavity of the chicken and your hands to support it, carefully transfer the chicken from the slow cooker to a cutting board, leaving the drippings behind.
