Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps.\nWhisk together honey, egg, and vanilla, then add to flour mixture and pulse just until dough comes together. (Dough will be soft.)\nTransfer dough to 1 sheet of trimmed parchment (not in pan) and cover with second sheet. Roll over with a rolling pin to spread dough evenly between sheets into a roughly 15- by 11-inch rectangle.\nTransfer dough in parchment to pan and remove top sheet.\nUsing wet offset spatula, spread dough into corners of pan to cover parchment completely. Holding a paring knife sideways, drag tip over dough at roughly 1/2-inch intervals to create lines resembling those on tree bark.\nSprinkle dough evenly with turbinado sugar. Bake in upper third of oven until set and dry to the touch, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 5 minutes.\nReduce oven temperature to 300°F.\nRun a knife around edge of pan, then invert bark onto a work surface. Discard parchment.\nFold bark in half lengthwise so that it breaks with uneven edges. Repeat with each piece. Tear each strip crosswise into 6 pieces.\nDivide biscuits, sugar sides up, between 2 baking sheets (biscuits may touch).
