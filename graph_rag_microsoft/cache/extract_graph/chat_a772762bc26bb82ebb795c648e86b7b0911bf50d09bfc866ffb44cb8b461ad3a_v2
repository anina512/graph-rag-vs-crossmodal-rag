We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nQuick Condensed Milk\n\nIngredients:\n['4 cups (32 ounces) milk (any percentage will do)', '3/4 cup (6 ounces) heavy cream', '1 cup (7 ounces) sugar', '1/8 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half as much if iodized)']\n\nInstructions:\nCombine milk, cream, sugar, and salt in a 5-quart stainless steel saucier. If using a scale, weigh the pot and ingredients together so you can digitally track the reduction. Place over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a heat resistant spatula, until the milk begins to simmer, about 12 minutes. Continue cooking another 30 minutes more, scraping continuously to prevent a milky buildup from forming around the sides. When the thickened milk-syrup suddenly begins to foam, it’s almost done. Keep simmering and stirring until the foam subsides and the dairy has condensed to exactly 2 cups or 19 ounces. If using a scale, the pot will weigh 26 ounces less than when you started.\nPour into an airtight container, seal to prevent evaporation, and refrigerate up to 1 month.

Identify all entities.

Proceed as directed. For an easy chai latte, stir 1 tablespoon of the spiced milk into 6 ounces (3/4 cup) hot black tea, such as Assam.\nDulce de Leche: This rich and nutty variation owes its caramel flavor and color to baking soda, which raises the dairy’s pH, allowing the lactose to brown at lower temperatures than normal. Add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the sugar and proceed as directed; though the mixture will foam more vigorously, there is no risk of overflow. Made with goat’s milk in the variation below, dulce de leche is known as cajeta.
