Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into 3/4-inch cubes.\nCut the bell peppers in half, cut out the stems and seeds, and cut the flesh into 3/4-inch cubes, then put them in the roasting pan. Use the back of a knife to lightly crush the 3 garlic cloves and add them to the pan. Drizzle with a little olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the sweet potatoes to the peppers and put the pan in the oven for 10–15 minutes, until the peppers have small black patches on the skins.\nMeanwhile, cut up store-bought sausages into bite-sized pieces and cook following the instructions on the package.\nTo make the piri piri sauce, peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic. Cut the bell pepper in half and cut out the stem and seeds. Rip the stems from the chiles, cut them in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds if you prefer a milder sauce. Put the onion, garlic, pepper, and chiles in the blender with the paprika, oregano, red wine vinegar, and basil. Grate in the zest of the lemon, then cut it in half and squeeze in the juice, catching any seeds. Add a drop of water and blend to a smooth paste.
