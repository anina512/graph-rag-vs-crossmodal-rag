We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef custom_entity_recognizer(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Define the entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\", \"LOWER\": \"techglobal\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\", \"LOWER\": \"samuel namara\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\", \"LOWER\": \"aurelia\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\", \"LOWER\": \"pibil-style pork\"},\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n    \n    # Add the patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n    \n    # Get the matches\n    matches = matcher(doc)\n    \n    # Create spans for the matches\n    for match_id, start, end in matches:\n        span = Span(doc, start, end, label=\"ENT_TYPE\")\n        doc.ents += (span,)\n    \n    return doc\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(custom_entity_recognizer(nlp(\"Pibil-Style Pork\")))\n```\n\n### Step 2: Extract entity information\n\nWe'll iterate over the entities and extract the required information.\n\n```python\n# Extract entity information\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}')\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Identify relationships between entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify relationships between entities.
