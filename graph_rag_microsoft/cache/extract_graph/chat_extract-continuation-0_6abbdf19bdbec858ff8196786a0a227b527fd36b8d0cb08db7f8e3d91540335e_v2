Cool filling to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\nPut oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place flan ring in center.\nRoll out larger disk of dough into an 11-inch round on a lightly floured surface with a floured rolling pin. (If dough is too firm to roll out, let stand at room temperature 5 minutes.) Fit dough into flan ring, pressing dough up side of ring (dough is very tender and tears easily; patch as needed; they will blend in during baking), then trim dough flush with top of ring. Spoon filling into crust and spread evenly.\nRoll out remaining disk of dough into a 9-inch round on lightly floured surface with floured rolling pin. Gently lay round over filling, then roll rolling pin over top to trim. Patch if necessary.\nBeat together remaining yolk and cream (1 tablespoon) in a cup with a fork and brush some of egg wash over top crust, then chill until egg wash appears darker and is slightly tacky, about 3 minutes. Brush with second coat of egg wash and chill again. Lightly score top with back of a small knife to make a decorative pattern and sprinkle with sesame seeds (1 teaspoon).\nBake tart until top is golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer tart on baking sheet to a rack and cool 10 minutes, then slide tart off parchment onto rack to cool. Gently remove ring.\nWhile tart bakes, stir together cream, honey, zest, and cardamom in a medium bowl and chill, covered. Just before serving, beat cream mixture with an electric mixer until it holds soft peaks.\nServe tart, warm or at room temperature, with cream and oranges.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>GEO<|>A container used to hold ingredients)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>A device used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>GEO<|>A flat surface used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLAN RING<|>GEO<|>A ring-shaped mold used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLAN<|>EVENT<|>A type of dessert)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG WASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mixture of egg and water used for brushing pastry)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Small particles used for decoration)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of fruit)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of dairy product)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HONEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sweet, viscous fluid produced by bees)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CARDAMOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of spice)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>YOLK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The yellow part of an egg)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROLLING PIN<|>GEO<|>A cylindrical tool used for rolling out dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLAT SURFACE<|>GEO<|>A surface used for rolling out dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN<|>GEO<|>A room used for cooking and preparing food)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BOWL<|>OVEN<|>The bowl is used to hold ingredients that are then baked in the oven<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>OVEN<|>The baking sheet is used in conjunction with the oven to bake food<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>FLAN RING<|>BAKING SHEET<|>The flan ring is placed on the baking sheet to bake the flan<|>3"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
