Let cool.\nHeat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange brussels sprouts cut side down in skillet and cook, undisturbed, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed, until browned all over, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce heat to medium; add butter, thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Tip skillet toward you so butter pools on one side and cook, spooning butter over brussels sprouts, until butter smells nutty, about 4 minutes; season with salt. Add vinegar and toss to coat. Cook just until vinegar and butter form a glaze over sprouts. Let cool; discard herbs.\nCombine vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and a big pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Finely grate in garlic and whisk to combine. Let sit 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat red pepper flakes, oregano, and 1/4 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium until oil is warm but not yet sizzling. Add remaining 2/3 cup oil to cool down infused oil.\nPour infused oil into vinegar mixture; whisk until smooth. Season vinaigrette with salt.\nToss chickpeas in a medium bowl with ¼ cup vinaigrette; season with salt. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until chickpeas taste like they’ve absorbed some vinaigrette, at least 10 minutes.\nToss scallions, salami, caciocavallo, olives, and dill into chickpeas. Scoop out bite-size pieces of roasted squash until you have 2 cups; save remaining squash for another use. Add to chickpea mixture along with brussels sprouts and glaze. Add radicchio and lettuce and toss to combine. Add more vinaigrette to taste; season with salt.\nServe salad topped with ricotta salata and pomegranate seeds.\nSquash and brussels sprouts can be cooked 3 days ahead. Cover and chill separately. Spoon pan juices for each on top. Vinaigrette can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BRUSSELS SPROUTS<|>GEO<|>Brussels sprouts are a type of vegetable that can be cooked in a skillet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>A large skillet is used to cook the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>GEO<|>Thyme is a type of herb used to add flavor to the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSEMARY<|>GEO<|>Rosemary is a type of herb used to add flavor to the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>GEO<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used to add flavor to the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>GEO<|>Butter is used to add flavor and moisture to the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINEGAR<|>GEO<|>Vinegar is used to add flavor and create a glaze for the brussels sprouts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKPEAS<|>GEO<|>Chickpeas are a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>GEO<|>Scallions are a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALAMI<|>GEO<|>Salami is a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CACIOCAVALLO<|>GEO<|>Caciocavallo is a type of cheese used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVES<|>GEO<|>Olives are a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DILL<|>GEO<|>Dill is a type of herb used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUASH<|>GEO<|>Squash is a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RADICCHIO<|>GEO<|>Radicchio is a type of ingredient used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LETTUCE<|>GEO<|>Lettuce is a type of ingredient"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
