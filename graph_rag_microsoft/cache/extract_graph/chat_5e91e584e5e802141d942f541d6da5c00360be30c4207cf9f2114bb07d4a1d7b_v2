Heating the oil can also be done over the edge of the cooker top so that it is done as gently as possible. When the oil is warm, place the separated, unpeeled garlic cloves in the oil and poach them gently for approximately 2 hours. They should be tender, easy to peel and thoroughly impregnated with oil. When ready, drain the oil, peel the garlic cloves, crush them, then pass them through a chinois and set aside.\nPlace the kaolin, lactose, black dye and salt in a bowl and mix together, gradually adding the water. The mixture may seem too dry at first, but if left for an hour or so will liquefy and develop a yogurt-like texture suitable for coating the boiled potatoes, thick but not runny.\nGently clean the potatoes with a soft brush. Do not peel. Bring the salted water to a boil in a large saucepan, then add the potatoes. Boil for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes, without overcooking them. Drain them and place on a baking sheet.\nPierce the flattest side of each potato with the tip of a skewer. Remove the skewer and insert its blunt end in the same hole until it reaches roughly the centre of the potato. Stir the kaolin mixture until thoroughly combined and of the correct consistency. Dip the potatoes into the mixture, completely covering them. Insert the ends of the skewers into the holes of a perforated baking sheet so that they are held in a vertical position. Place the sheet in a stove or oven at a low temperature—50°C (120°F)—for approximately 30 minutes or until\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5e91e584e5e802141d942f541d6da5c00360be30c4207cf9f2114bb07d4a1d7b_v2"}
