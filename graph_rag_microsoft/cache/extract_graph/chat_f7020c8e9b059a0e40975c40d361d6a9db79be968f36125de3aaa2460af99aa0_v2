Add half the butter and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs appear. With the machine running, add 1/4 cup ice water and process until the dough just holds together. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers and if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (2 tablespoons maximum). Do not over process.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine. Flatten into a disc, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight. Repeat the same procedure with remaining 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and butter. Flatten into a second disc and refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 425°F. Position one oven rack on the bottom rung and one in the center of the oven. Completely line bottom rack with foil to catch filling drips and place one 13x18-inch rimmed baking sheet on top of foil to preheat.\nGrease another 13x18-inch rimmed baking sheet with butter. On a floured surface, roll out 1 disc of dough into a 14x19-inch rectangle, about 1/8-inch thick. Roll dough onto rolling pin and unfurl onto greased baking sheet.
