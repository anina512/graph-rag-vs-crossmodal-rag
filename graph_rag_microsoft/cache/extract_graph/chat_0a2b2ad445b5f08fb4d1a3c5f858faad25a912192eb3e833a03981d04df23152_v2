Combine zucchini, peppers, and onions in medium bowl. Add oil and 1 tablespoon rosemary; toss to coat. Spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool.\nPreheat oven to 375°F. Mix ground beef, mozzarella, panko, basil, marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, dried crushed pepper, 1 tablespoon rosemary, and 1 cup roasted vegetables in large bowl. Whisk 1/2 cup ketchup, eggs, and wine in medium bowl. Add to beef mixture; stir with wooden spoon until well incorporated; spoon into 9x5x3-inch loaf pan, forming rounded top.\nSpoon 1/2 cup ketchup over top of loaf. Bake meatloaf until cooked through, juices run clear, and top is browned, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove pan from oven; let meatloaf rest 20 minutes.\nRewarm remaining vegetable mixture in large nonstick skillet. Turn meatloaf out; cut into 1-inch-thick slices. Top with warm roasted vegetable mixture; serve with mashed potatoes.\n*Flaky panko crumbs are the best substitute for fresh breadcrumbs in almost anything, including meatloaf. Look for them in the Asian foods section of the supermarket and at Asian markets.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0a2b2ad445b5f08fb4d1a3c5f858faad25a912192eb3e833a03981d04df23152_v2"}
