Pour in 14 cups water (pork should be submerged). Bring to a simmer and cook, skimming as needed and turning pork occasionally, until meat is cooked through and tender but not yet falling apart, 2 1/2–3 hours. Transfer pork to a plate; let cool slightly. Strain broth into a large bowl, then transfer back to pot. Slice pork into 1/2\" slices and add to broth.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Toast all the chiles on a rimmed baking sheet until brown (do not char) and starting to lightly puff in places, about 5 minutes. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan; add chiles. Remove from heat and let chiles soak until softened, 10–12 minutes. Blend chiles and cooking liquid in a blender until smooth; season with salt.\nAdd chile purée to pork and broth. Bring to a simmer, add hominy, and cook, skimming off fat from surface, until pork is so tender it’s nearly falling apart, 45–60 minutes; season with more salt.\nDivide posole among bowls, top with onion, cabbage, radishes, and oregano. Serve with lime wedges.\nPosole can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RED POSOLE WITH PORK<|>EVENT<|>Red Posole with Pork is a recipe for a traditional Mexican dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PORK SHOULDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pork shoulder is a cut of meat used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOSTON BUTT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Boston butt is a type of pork shoulder)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White onion is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GUAJILLO CHILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Guajillo chiles are a type of pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHILES DE ÁRBOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chiles de árbol are a type of pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE HOMINY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White hominy is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CABBAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cabbage is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RADISHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Radishes are an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OREGANO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oregano is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIME WEDGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime wedges are an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, so we ignore this)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not in the text, so we ignore this)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not in the text, so we ignore this)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
