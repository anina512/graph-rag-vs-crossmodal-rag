Cover and let sit overnight at cool room temperature (around or below 60°F) or in the refrigerator.\nThe next morning, add the ginger and the white parts of the green onions to the pot. Partially cover (a small gap is perfect to minimize evaporation and avoid a boil over) and bring to vigorous simmer over high heat. Lower the heat and gently simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed. When done, most of the liquid will have been absorbed (you’ll see little separation between the rice and liquid). Discard the ginger and green onions.
