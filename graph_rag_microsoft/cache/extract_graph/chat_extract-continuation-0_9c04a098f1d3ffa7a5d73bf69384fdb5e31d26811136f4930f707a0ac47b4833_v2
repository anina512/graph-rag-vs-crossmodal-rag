If your molds are flexible like the ones we use at the museum, set them on a rimmed baking sheet.\nPlace the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl, add the vanilla extract, and set aside.\nIn a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking often to break up the lumps of cocoa powder, until bubbles start to form around the edges and the temperature of the mixture registers 180°F to 190°F on a digital thermometer.\nImmediately pour the cream mixture over the chocolate and stir with a whisk or blend with an immersion blender until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is a smooth liquid (a thoroughly emulsified mixture will yield the most creamy fudge pop). Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a liquid measuring cup.\nPour the chocolate mixture into the ice-pop molds and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours or up to 2 weeks; follow the manufacturer's instructions for inserting the sticks. If you don't have ice-pop molds, pour the chocolate mixture into ice cube trays; freeze until partially frozen, about 30 minutes, and then insert a toothpick or short wooden skewer into each ice pop. Continue freezing until solid.\nUnmold the fudge pops, dipping the molds into warm water to loosen, if needed, and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>KELLY FUDGE POP<|>EVENT<|>Kelly Fudge Pop is a recipe for a chocolate ice pop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole milk is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural unsweetened cocoa powder is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a key ingredient in the Kelly Fudge Pop recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE-POL MOLDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ice-pop molds are used to make the Kelly Fudge Pop)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIMMED BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rimmed baking sheet is used to set the ice-pop molds on)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM HEAVY-BOTTOMED SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medium heavy-bottomed saucepan is used to cook the cream mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A digital thermometer is used to check the temperature of the cream mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMERSION BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An immersion blender is used to blend the chocolate mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH SIEVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A fine-mesh sieve is used to strain the chocolate mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUID MEASURING CUP<|>ORG"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
