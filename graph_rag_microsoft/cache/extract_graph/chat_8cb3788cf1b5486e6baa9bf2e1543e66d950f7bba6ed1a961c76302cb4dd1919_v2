Whisk in tahini and oil.\nScrape tahini mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated (mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand).\nThe peaches should look juicy at this point. Add 1 tsp. cornstarch. If they’re really juicy, add another 1 tsp. Gently toss to combine. (If your peaches happen to be not-so-ripe and aren't juicy, don't add any cornstarch.)\nSqueeze topping into big clumps, then break off uneven pieces and scatter over peaches.\nBake crumble until topping is well browned and firm, peaches are tender, and juices are bubbling, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly.\nDivide crumble among shallow bowls and add a scoop of ice cream if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8cb3788cf1b5486e6baa9bf2e1543e66d950f7bba6ed1a961c76302cb4dd1919_v2"}
