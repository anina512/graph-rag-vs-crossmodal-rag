Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entity information and format it as required.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    # Process the text\n    doc = nlp(text)\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the entities\n    entities = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities in the document\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        # Check if the entity type is in the list of entity types\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            # Extract the entity information\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n\n            # Format the entity as required\n            entity = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}>{entity_type}>{entity_description})\"\n\n            # Add the entity to the list\n            entities.append(entity)\n\n    return entities\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between entities. We'll use a simple approach to identify related entities, such as entities that appear together in the text.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the relationships\n    relationships = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            # Check if the entities are related\n            if entities[i].split(\"<\")[1] == entities[j].split(\"<\")[1]:\n                # Extract the relationship information\n                source_entity = entities[i].split(\"<\")[1]\n                target_entity = entities[j].split(\"<\")[1]\n                relationship_description = f\"The {source_entity} and {target_entity} are related because they appear together in the text.\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n\n                # Format the relationship as required\n                relationship = f\"({source_entity}<{target_entity}>{relationship_description}>{relationship_strength})\"\n\n                # Add the relationship to the list\n                relationships.append(relationship)\n\n    return relationships\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine the entities and relationships\n\nWe'll", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763460663, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2262, "total_tokens": 2774, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.

Yummers!\nDepending on how large your crab is, the two halves of crab legs can be broken into either 2 or 3 sections (there should be a minimum of 2 legs per section) using the same cleaving action as you did to halve the crab.\nAnd that’s it! (If YouTube, this, and the web doesn’t help you feel more comfortable—seriously, feel free to reach out to us: @starrykitchen. This dish is COMPLETELY worth it.)\nNow clean the crab legs again, then pat dry with paper towels. Put into a big bowl with cornstarch, but make sure to leave enough room to coat crab with starch.\nDiligently dredge all exposed crab pieces including the coral and head, inside and out, with starch. Next, shake off excess starch, but make sure all of the exposed (non-shelled) parts are covered in starch. This seals in all of the crab’s flavors throughout the cooking process. This is especially important if you need to prepare in advance.\nFill a wok/pot with 2 to 3 inches cooking oil, enough to submerge crab pieces, including the head. Heat oil to 350°F over high heat, then carefully fry in batches, arranging crab pieces in a single layer in the oil. Turn over pieces with tongs to fry evenly.\nWhen the crab pieces turn red all over and the battered parts are golden, remove and shake the excess oil over your pot. Set aside (we like to set crab on a rack/grate and baking sheet to allow a little bit more oil to drip off). Refrigerate for up to 24 hours.\nOnce you’re ready to make your chili crab, heat a wok/pan on high heat and add 1 tablespoon cooking oil per crab. Sauté garlic, shallots, ginger, and chiles until aromatic (enough to make you cough—that’s how you know you got the GOOD stuff). Next, add the beautiful monstrosity that is your crab. Stir quickly for 10 to 15 seconds, then add Chili Crab Sauce. Cover, cook over high heat, and cook that bad boy (or girl) for 7 minutes.\nKeep the pan over heat, but remove crab from pan and place on a serving dish.
