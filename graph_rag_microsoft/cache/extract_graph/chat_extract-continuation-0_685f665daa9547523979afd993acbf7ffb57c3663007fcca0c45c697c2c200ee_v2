Let stand until bloomed, about 2 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine hot coffee and sugar in a loaf pan or large resealable container. Gently stir gelatin mixture into coffee until combined (do not stir too vigorously or air bubbles will appear). Chill until firm, about 2 hours.\nUsing an electric mixer on medium-high speed or a whisk, whip cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar and vanilla and whip to medium peaks.\nBlend coffee, syrup, cream, sugar, vanilla, and 3 cups ice in a blender until smooth.\nCut coffee jelly into 3/4” cubes. Fill 4 tall glasses with 1/2 cup cubed coffee jelly each. Spoon 3 Tbsp. whipped cream over each and spread to create a solid layer of cream. Divide frozen iced coffee (about 1 cup each) among glasses on top of cream layer. Top with more whipped cream and serve immediately with bubble tea straws.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>POWDERED UNFLAVORED GELATIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Powdered unflavored gelatin is a type of gelatin used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COFFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coffee is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate syrup is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUBBLE TEA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bubble tea is a type of drink used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FROZEN ICED COFFEE<|>EVENT<|>Frozen iced coffee is the main event of the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COFFEE JELLY<|>EVENT<|>Coffee jelly is a key component of the frozen iced coffee)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a location in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is a location in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Krohaara is a location in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Cashion is a location in the recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POWDERED UNFLAVORED GELATIN<|>COFFEE<|>Powdered unflavored gelatin is used to make coffee jelly<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POWDERED UNFLAVORED GELATIN<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
