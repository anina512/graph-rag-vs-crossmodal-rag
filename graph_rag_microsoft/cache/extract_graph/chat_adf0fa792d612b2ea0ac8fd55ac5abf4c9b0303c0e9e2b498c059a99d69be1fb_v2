Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\nnlp.add_pipe(nlp.create_pipe(\"entity_ruler\"))\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the entity patterns\npatterns = [\n    {\"label\": \"ORGANIZATION\", \"pattern\": r\"TechGlobal\"},\n    {\"label\": \"PERSON\", \"pattern\": r\"Samuel Namara\"},\n    {\"label\": \"GEO\", \"pattern\": r\"Firuzabad\"},\n    {\"label\": \"EVENT\", \"pattern\": r\"hostage exchange\"},\n]\n\n# Add the entity patterns to the custom entity recognition model\nnlp.add_pipe(\"entity_ruler\", config={\"patterns\": patterns})\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Rhubarb and Raspberry Jam Roly-Poly with Vanilla Custard Sauce\")\n\n# Extract the entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}')\")\n\n# Print the entities\nprint(\"##\".join(entities))\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all relationships among the identified entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform relationship extraction on the text.

Identify all entities.

Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Cover; cook until rhubarb softens to thick pulp, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Mix in jam; cool. do ahead Can be made 1 week ahead. Cover; chill.\nSift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into large bowl. Using large holes on box grater, grate frozen butter into bowl; stir to blend. Cover and freeze at least 15 minutes. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep frozen.\nPreheat oven to 400°F. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Add 2/3 cup ice water to flour mixture, tossing until soft dough forms, adding more ice water by tablespoonfuls if dough is stiff. Transfer to lightly floured surface; knead gently 5 or 6 turns (butter should remain in firm pieces). Roll out dough to 12x9-inch rectangle. Spread 6 tablespoons filling over dough, leaving 1-inch plain border on all sides. Starting at 1 long side, roll up jelly-roll style; seal seam. Place seam side down on prepared sheet. Seal ends. Brush glaze over pastry.\nBake pastry until golden (jam may leak out), about 30 minutes. Cool pastry briefly.\nCut roly-poly crosswise into 6 to 8 rounds.
