Spray 8 mini loaf pans with nonstick vegetable oil spray then dust the pans with flour, tapping out any excess.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, light or brown sugar, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Drizzle in the grapeseed oil then whisk until the mixture resembles wet sand. Measure out 1 cup of the mixture and reserve it for the topping.\nAdd the baking soda and baking powder to the large bowl and stir with a spatula to combine. Add the eggs and stir to combine then add the buttermilk and stir to combine—the batter will have some lumps. Scoop about 1 cup of batter into each of the prepared pans, smoothing the tops. Sprinkle the reserved topping in very small clumps over the top of each cake and bake until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, then invert onto the rack to unmold. DO AHEAD: Coffee cakes can be baked in advance, cooled, covered, and kept at room temperature for up to 24 hours.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_df2e693943d80f7acb514e39b0aa03a5e7b235fd50ea63ebdc62f59cc7d54c94_v2"}
