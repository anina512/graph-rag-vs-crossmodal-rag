Set a heavy-bottomed 12-inch nonstick or cast iron skillet over low heat while preparing meat, vegetable, garlic, and eggs. Marinate the meat in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Three to four minutes from making the fried rice, increase the heat to high and turn on the exhaust fan.\n2. Put 1 tablespoon of oil and the onion in the skillet; stir-fry until the onion is still crisp but starts to turn brown, about 1 minute. Add the raw meat or vegetable; stir-fry until crisp-tender for vegetables or lightly browned for meat, about 1 minute. Add the cooked meat or vegetable; stir-fry until lightly browned, about 1 minute longer. (If both meat and vegetables are raw or cooked, stir-fry the meat first, giving it a little head start.) Stir in the garlic, then transfer the mixture to a plate; set aside.\n3. Put the remaining 3 tablespoons oil in the skillet; heat until shimmering. Add the rice; stir-fry, breaking up clumps, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add the egg; stir until scrambled, about 1 minute. Return the meat/vegetable mixture, along with the remaining 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and the scallions, to the pan and stir to combine. Serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SIMPLE FRIED RICE<|>EVENT<|>Simple Fried Rice is a dish made with rice, meat, and vegetables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>PERSON<|>Onion is a type of vegetable used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEAT<|>PERSON<|>Meat is a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE<|>PERSON<|>Vegetable is a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>PERSON<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Soy sauce is a type of condiment used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKED RICE<|>PERSON<|>Cooked rice is a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>PERSON<|>Scallions are a type of ingredient used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLE<|>GEO<|>Pole is a type of location where the onion is halved)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>Skillet is a type of cooking vessel used in Simple Fried Rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST IRON<|>GEO<|>Cast iron is a type of material used in the skillet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NONSTICK<|>GEO<|>Nonstick is a type of material used in the skillet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONION<|>MEAT<|>Onion and meat are both ingredients used in Simple Fried Rice<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ONION<|>VEGETABLE<|>Onion and vegetable are both ingredients used in Simple Fried Rice<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEAT<|>VEGETABLE<|>Meat and vegetable are"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
