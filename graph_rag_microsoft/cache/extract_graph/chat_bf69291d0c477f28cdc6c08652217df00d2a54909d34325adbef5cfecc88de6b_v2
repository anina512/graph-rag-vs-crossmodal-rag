(20 g) Dutch-process or unsweetened cocoa powder', '1 Tbsp. light corn syrup', 'Special Equipment: A 3\"-diameter cookie cutter']\n\nInstructions:\nWhisk baking powder, 2½ cups flour, and 1½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Pulse mint and granulated sugar in a food processor until mint is finely chopped. Add butter; process to combine. Add dry ingredients and pulse again to combine. Add egg and egg yolk; pulse until a shaggy dough forms.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead just until dough holds its shape. Divide dough in half; pat each portion into a 1\"-thick disk. Wrap disks in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to about ¼\" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to keep from sticking. Punch out rounds with lightly floured cookie cutter and arrange on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1\" apart. Pat dough scraps into a 1\"-thick disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 10 minutes if soft. Repeat process with scraps.\nHold a bench scraper or straightedge upright 1\" from edge of a cookie to cordon off a shallow semicircle (do not press down into dough; you’re just making a barrier). Coat semicircle with sanding sugar; gently press to adhere. Remove scraper; you should have a tidy sugared edge. Repeat with remaining cookies and more sanding sugar.\nBake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are lightly browned,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bf69291d0c477f28cdc6c08652217df00d2a54909d34325adbef5cfecc88de6b_v2"}
