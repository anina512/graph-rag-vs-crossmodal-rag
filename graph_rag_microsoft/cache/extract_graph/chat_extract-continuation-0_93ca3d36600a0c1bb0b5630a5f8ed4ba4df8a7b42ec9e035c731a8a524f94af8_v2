Dijon or whole grain mustard', '½ tsp. honey or agave nectar', '¼ tsp. kosher salt', '¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '3 cups still-warm Big-Batch Parmesan Polenta', '⅓ cup finely grated Parmesan', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ red onion or 1 shallot, thinly sliced', '1 (heaping) cup thinly sliced raw crunchy vegetables (such as fennel, radishes, and/or celery)', '¼ tsp. kosher salt', '1 head of radicchio, escarole, or romaine, leaves separated, torn into bite-size pieces', '2 oz. thinly sliced salami, prosciutto, or other cured meat (optional)', '1 cup olives, pickles, peperoncini, or marinated artichoke hearts, sliced if desired', '½ cup (loosely packed) tender herbs (such as basil, parsley, mint, and/or dill)']\n\nInstructions:\nWhisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, honey, salt, and pepper in a small bowl (or shake together in a small jar). Set aside.\nPour polenta into a square or rectangular airtight container and spread into an even layer. Let cool, then cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 week. (The polenta will set into a solid block.)\nTurn out polenta onto a cutting board and cut into 1” cubes. Place Parmesan in a wide shallow bowl and, working in batches, toss cubes in cheese to coat. Using your hands, press cheese against edges of polenta to adhere, then transfer to a plate.\nHeat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high. Working in batches as needed, place as many polenta cubes as will fit in an even layer with 1” space between each in skillet. Let fry, undisturbed, until bottoms are crisp and browned, about 4 minutes. Resist the urge to move the cubes before 3 minutes have passed to avoid pulling the Parmesan coating off the polenta. Turn over one at a time, making sure cubes don’t stick together, and repeat cooking process with opposite sides of cubes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
