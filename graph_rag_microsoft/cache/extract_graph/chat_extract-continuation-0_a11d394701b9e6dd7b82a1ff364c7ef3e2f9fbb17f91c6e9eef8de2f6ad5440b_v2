Slide the disks off the baking sheet onto a flat surface to cool.\n11. To make the filling, combine all the ingredients in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan and bring to a light simmer. Immediately transfer to the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and pulse into a thick paste.\n12. To assemble the cake, spread about 1 cup of the filling onto each layer, taking care to center each disk on top of the one beneath it. Repeat until all the layers are used. Do not put apple filling on top of the cake.\n13. Wrap the cake well and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. This gives the apple filling time to work itself into the cake.
