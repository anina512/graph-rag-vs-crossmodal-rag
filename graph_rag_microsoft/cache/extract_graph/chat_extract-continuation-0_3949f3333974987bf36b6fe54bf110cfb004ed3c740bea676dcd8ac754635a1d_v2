Scrape out and reserve seeds.\nAdd 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Working in two to three batches, sear bok choy on all sides until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per cut side. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper to each batch, and 1 teaspoon oil to sear each subsequent batch of bok choy.\nAdd 1 teaspoon oil to the skillet and sauté apples with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until softened but still holding their shape, 5 to 7 minutes. Reserve apples.\nAdd remaining tablespoon oil to skillet and sear sausages on all sides until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add toasted caraway seeds, sauerkraut, and broth. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, cover the skillet, and simmer until sausages are cooked through (150°F for pork sausages, 160°F for poultry sausages), about 10 minutes. Remove cover and fold in reserved bok choy, apples, vinegar, and butter. Cook, tossing, until some of the liquid has evaporated and the bok choy and apples are warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve with mustard for dipping.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SAUERKRAUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sausage with Sauerkraut is a dish that includes sauerkraut as an ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOK CHOY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bok Choy is a type of vegetable used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sausage is a type of meat used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAWAY SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caraway seeds are a type of spice used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONEYCRISP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Honeycrisp is a type of apple used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GALA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gala is a type of apple used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIJON MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dijon mustard is a type of condiment used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUERKRAUT<|>PERSON<|>Sauerkraut is a type of fermented cabbage used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>PERSON<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOK CHOY<|>PERSON<|>Bok Choy is a type of vegetable used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUSAGE<|>PERSON<|>Sausage is a type of meat used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAWAY SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>Caraway seeds are a type of spice used in the Sausage with Sauerkraut"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
