Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify the entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Dependency parsing**: Analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence to identify relationships between entities.\n5. **Relationship extraction**: Identify relationships between entities based on the dependency parsing results.\n6. **Entity and relationship formatting**: Format the extracted entities and relationships according to the required output format.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform these tasks:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Baked Pasta Shells with Sausage and Greens\"\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Extract entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"({entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description})\")\n\n# Extract relationships\nrelationships = []\nfor token in doc:\n    if token.dep_ == \"nsubj\":\n        subject = token.head.text\n        subject_type = token.head.label_\n        subject_description = token.head.text\n        for child in token.children:\n            if child.dep_ == \"dobj\":\n                object = child.text\n                object_type = child.label_\n                object_description = child.text\n                relationship_description = f\"{subject} {token.dep_} {object}\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n                relationships.append(f\"({subject}<|>{object}<|>{relationship_description}<|>{relationship_strength})\")\n\n# Print the entities and relationships\nprint(\"##\".join(entities))\nprint(\"##\".join(relationships))\nprint(\"<|COMPLETE|>\")\n```\nThis code uses the spaCy library to perform the following tasks:\n\n1.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Fontina and/or aged cheddar, coarsely grated, divided', '1 lb. ridged medium pasta shells (such as lumaconi) or large tube pasta (such as rigatoni)', '1 bunch broccoli rabe, stems cut into 2\" pieces, leafy ends left long']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace racks in middle and upper third of oven; preheat to 325°F. Heat a large, deep ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Pour in ¼ cup oil; add sausage and break up into small pieces. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 4 minutes. Stir a few times; cook, undisturbed, until cooked through, about 3 minutes.\nAdd garlic, chopped sage, and red pepper flakes to sausage and cook, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Mix in half-and-half and simmer until thickened slightly, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stirring constantly, gradually add two-thirds of the cheese a little at a time, letting it melt before adding more. Cook, stirring, until sauce is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes; season with salt. Remove from heat.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and adding broccoli rabe during the last 2 minutes, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain in a colander, shaking well. Return pasta and broccoli rabe to pot.\nAdd sausage mixture to pasta and toss to coat; transfer to skillet. Cover with foil and bake on middle rack until pasta is al dente and sauce is bubbling, 30–40 minutes. Remove from oven. Heat broiler.\nTop pasta with remaining cheese. Toss sage leaves and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl; arrange over pasta. Broil on upper rack until cheese is browned in spots, about 5 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3cac25544849866109d31c473aaaab647c87cbb4c568246b33890681dd5cff21_v2"}
