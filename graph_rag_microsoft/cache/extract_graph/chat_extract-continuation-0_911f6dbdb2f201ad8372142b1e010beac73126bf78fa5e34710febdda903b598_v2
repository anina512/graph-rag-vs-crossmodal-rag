If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160°F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.\nReduce oven temperature to 400°F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add reserved 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo, remaining 3 Tbsp. mayo, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and whisk to combine, then stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Set dressing aside.\nAdd bread to reserved skillet with fat and turn to coat. Return skillet to oven and toast bread, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, 12–15 minutes. Transfer croutons to bowl with reserved dressing. Add romaine and gently toss until lettuce is well coated. Season salad with salt and pepper.\nSlice remaining lemon into wedges. Carve chicken and nestle back into skillet or transfer to a platter; arrange shallots and lemon wedges around. Serve with salad and more mustard alongside.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BREAST<|>GEO<|>The thickest part of the breast registers 155°F, 45–55 minutes)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SKIN<|>GEO<|>The skin starts to get too dark on the top before the chicken is done)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chicken is being cooked in the oven)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The shallots are being cooked in the skillet)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>The skillet is being used to cook the chicken and shallots)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>The oven is being used to cook the chicken and croutons)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The lemon is being used to make the dressing)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ANCHOVY MAYO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The anchovy mayo is being used to make the dressing)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MAYO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The mayo is being used to make the dressing)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The oil is being used to make the dressing)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Parmesan is being used to make the dressing)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROMAINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The romaine is being used to make the salad)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRUTONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The croutons are being used to make the salad)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The mustard is being served alongside the chicken and salad)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BREAST<|>SKIN<|>The breast and skin are related because the skin is getting too dark on the top before the chicken is done<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>SHALLOTS<|>The chicken and shallots are related because they are being cooked in the skillet<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SKILLET<|>OVEN<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
