Heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch, about 4 minutes.\nFit bowl onto mixer fitted with whisk attachment (or use an electric mixer) and beat on medium-high speed until meringue is more than tripled in volume and medium peaks form, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip (or a resealable plastic bag will work—just snip off a corner after bag is filled). Pipe meringue over filling and toast with a kitchen torch or under the broiler.\nDo Ahead: Pie (without meringue) can be made 2 days ahead.
