Gently brush the entire surface of the loaves with egg wash, taking care not to let it pool in the creases of the braids. You want a nice thin coating. Generously sprinkle the loaves with the seeds. [Note: At the bakery, we dip the egg-washed dough facedown into a large tray of seeds and then roll it from side to side to heavily coat the bread. If you just sprinkle a few pinches over the top, it won’t look very generous or appealing after the bread has expanded and baked, so be generous with the seeds whether sprinkling or rolling.]\nBake for 15 minutes. Rotate the bottom sheet pan to the top and the top sheet pan to the bottom (turning each sheet around as you go), and bake until the loaves are golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Remove the loaves from the oven and set them aside to cool completely on the sheet pans.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BAKERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The bakery is a place where bread is made and sold)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>PERSON<|>The egg is a food item used in the egg wash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>PERSON<|>Water is a liquid used in the egg wash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a seasoning used in the egg wash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>PERSON<|>The dough is a mixture of flour, water, and yeast used to make bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOAVES<|>PERSON<|>The loaves are the breads that are being made and baked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>The seeds are a topping used to decorate the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WASH<|>PERSON<|>The egg wash is a mixture of egg, water, and salt used to brush the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING<|>EVENT<|>Baking is the process of cooking bread in an oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>The oven is a device used to cook bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOLING<|>EVENT<|>Cooling is the process of letting the bread sit at room temperature to stop the cooking process)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>EGG<|>The bakery uses eggs in the egg wash<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>WATER<|>The bakery uses water in the egg wash<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>SALT<|>The bakery uses salt in the egg wash<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>DOUGH<|>The bakery uses dough to make bread<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>LOAVES<|>The bakery makes loaves of bread<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>SEEDS<|>The bakery uses seeds to decorate the bread<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAKERY<|>EGG WASH<|>The bakery"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
