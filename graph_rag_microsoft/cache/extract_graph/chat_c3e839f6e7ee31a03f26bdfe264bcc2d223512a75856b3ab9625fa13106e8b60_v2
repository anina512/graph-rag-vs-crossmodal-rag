Add shallots and garlic. Sauté until tender, about 7 minutes. Add peas and stir 1 minute. Add 5 1/2 cups broth and bring to simmer. Cook until peas are very tender, about 8 minutes. Cool 15 minutes. Puree soup and 1/4 cup chopped mint in batches in blender until smooth. Return to same pot; thin with more broth by 1/4 cupfuls, if desired. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool, cover, and chill.\nRewarm soup over medium-low heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls; garnish with additional mint.\nA bottle of bubbly is the perfect way to begin this special meal. It's also a great pairing for the soup.
