Sprinkle flour over top and cook, stirring, until flour is no longer visible. Return chicken to pot, arranging skin side up in a single layer, and pour in reserved infused wine (it should come just to the top of the chicken pieces; add water to get it there if needed). Bring liquid to a gentle simmer, partially cover pot, and cook chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 160°F, 30–40 minutes.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil and 1 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium. Add pearl onions, season with salt, and cook, shaking skillet often, until onions are browned all over, 8–10 minutes. Add water to barely cover onions and partially cover skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until onions are tender all the way through, 15–20 minutes; set aside.\nTransfer chicken to a platter and tent with foil. Strain braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard solids. Return liquid to pot and set over medium heat. Whisk vinegar, cocoa, and 3 Tbsp. braising liquid in a small bowl until smooth, then stir into braising liquid in pot. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and silky smooth, 5–10 minutes. Add pearl onions with cooking liquid and reserved bacon and mushrooms and cook until just heated through.
