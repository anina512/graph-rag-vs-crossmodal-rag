Add the noodles and cook for 7 to 10 minutes or until tender. Drain the noodles and set aside.\nIn a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until tender.\nWhisk the eggs lightly with a fork. Pour them into the skillet and cook just until they solidify, but are still moist, moving the eggs around the skillet slightly as they cook so that they lightly scramble. When the eggs are cooked, remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes. Pour the sauce into the skillet with the scrambled eggs. Add the noodles and toss to coat in the sauce.\nSprinkle the green onions, cilantro, and peanuts over the noodles. Toss lightly to combine. Serve warm.\nPad thai noodles have a unique flavor and texture, but if you can't find them in your area, try substituting another flat pasta like linguine.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3ff5e53eb6d5872caf8f211e3c4763ba880258fd913a09f859c890d69e81f571_v2"}
