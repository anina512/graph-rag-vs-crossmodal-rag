Reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer, whisking occasionally, until liquid is absorbed and grits are tender and creamy, 20–25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, pulse almonds in a food processor until texture of coarse breadcrumbs. Transfer to a shallow baking dish; season with salt and pepper.\nPlace egg in another shallow baking dish. Season trout with salt and pepper. Working one at a time, dip skin side of fillets into egg, then in almonds, pressing to adhere. Transfer to a plate as you go.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over mediumhigh until very hot but not smoking. Cook 2 fillets, almond side down, pressing with a spatula occasionally to ensure contact with skillet, until almonds are well toasted and fish is nearly cooked through, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until opaque throughout, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining fillets.\nWipe out skillet. Add chard and shallot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing, until chard is wilted, about 2 minutes. Serve chard and trout over grits with lemon wedges.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e602445de2b036dfbb37a324b9ca378dcdf77bcc43289fa00467db46f92e2b20_v2"}
