Serve with lime wedges.\nRice Salad, Indian Style: Use brown or white basmati rice. When making the vinaigrette, use rice wine vinegar, replace the oil with coconut milk, and add 1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste. Instead of the bell pepper, celery, and carrot, add 1/2 cup each cubed cooked potato, cooked cauliflower florets, and green peas (cooked frozen are fine). Substitute cilantro for the parsley.\nCitrus Rice Salad: Use any rice. Instead of red wine vinegar, make the vinaigrette with freshly squeezed citrus juice—choose from lemon, lime, orange, blood orange, tangerine, pink grapefruit, or a combination. Whatever you use, add 2 tablespoons of the grated zest and 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey to the blender. Do not include the scallion or the vegetables. (You might want to use a little less dressing.) Instead of the parsley, use mint if you like. A handful of chopped almonds or pecans make a nice addition.\nTomato Rice Salad: Use any kind of brown or white rice. When making the vinaigrette, eliminate the vinegar and add 1 medium tomato to the blender. Instead of the scallion and other vegetables, add 2 cups chopped fresh tomato (a mixture of heirloom varieties is nice).Instead of the parsley, use chopped fresh basil or mint, or 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives, chervil, dill, or about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Parsley is a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>PERSON<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JALAPEÑO CHILES<|>PERSON<|>Jalapeño chiles are a type of pepper used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIME WEDGES<|>PERSON<|>Lime wedges are a common garnish for many dishes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE SALAD<|>EVENT<|>Rice salad is a type of dish made with rice and various ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN STYLE<|>EVENT<|>Indian style is a type of cuisine that originated in India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASMATI RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Basmati rice is a type of rice commonly used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE WINE VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rice wine vinegar is a type of vinegar used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coconut milk is a type of milk used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRY POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Curry powder is a type of spice used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>PERSON<|>Celery is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROT<|>PERSON<|>Carrot is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELL PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Bell pepper is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>PERSON<|>Cilantro is a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN PEAS<|>PERSON<|>Green peas are a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITRUS RICE SALAD<|>EVENT<|>Citrus rice salad is a type of dish made with rice and citrus juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
