Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.\nCombine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and coarse salt in processor; blend 5 seconds. Add butter. Using on/off turns, blend until mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add 1 cup oats and blueberries; stir to blend evenly.\nStir half and half and vanilla in small bowl.
