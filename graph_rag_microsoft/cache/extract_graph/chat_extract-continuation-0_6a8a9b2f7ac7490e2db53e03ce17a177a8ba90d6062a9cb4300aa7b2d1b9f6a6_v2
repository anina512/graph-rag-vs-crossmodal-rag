Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Entity Identification**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll identify entities of the types specified in the `entity_types` list.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n        entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_, ent._.description))\n\n# Format entities as required\nentities = [f\"({entity_type})<{entity_name.upper()}<{entity_type.upper()}<{entity_description}>\" for entity_name, entity_type, entity_description in entities]\n```\n\n**Step 2: Relationship Identification**\n\nWe'll use a combination of NLP and machine learning techniques to identify relationships between entities.
