Shovel smoldering coals from sides over package using spatulas, burying it as well as possible.\nCook fish 30 minutes. (Some of paper will burn. If paper flames, cover grill briefly.)\nWearing mitts and using both spatulas, carefully uncover package (douse any flames with water if necessary) and transfer to baking pan.
