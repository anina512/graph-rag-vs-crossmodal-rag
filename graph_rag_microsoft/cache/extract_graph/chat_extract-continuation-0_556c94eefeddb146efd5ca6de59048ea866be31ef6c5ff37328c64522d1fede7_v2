The chicken should be fully covered by the hot oil. It’s fully cooked when it reaches 165°F at its thickest part, 5 to 7 minutes. If you don’t have a well-calibrated thermometer handy, it’s okay to cut into the chicken slightly and check for doneness—no more pink. The chicken will stay juicy because we did all the work of properly brining . . . phew!\nRemove the chicken to the cooling rack or paper towels. You can keep the chicken warm and crispy in a 200°F oven or serve immediately. Just before serving, drizzle the chicken with your favorite local wildflower honey and garnish with a pinch of coarse sea salt.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken is the main ingredient in this recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILD FLOWER HONEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wildflower honey is a type of honey that is used as a topping for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEA SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sea salt is a type of salt that is used as a garnish for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL<|>GEO<|>The chicken is served with local wildflower honey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADE SHALLOW FRYER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chicken is cooked in a makeshift deep-fryer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOLING RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chicken is placed on a cooling rack to cool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chicken is placed on paper towels to cool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>200°F OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chicken is kept warm in a 200°F oven)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>WILD FLOWER HONEY<|>The chicken is served with wildflower honey<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>SEA SALT<|>The chicken is garnished with sea salt<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>LOCAL<|>The chicken is served with local wildflower honey<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>MADE SHALLOW FRYER<|>The chicken is cooked in a makeshift deep-fryer<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>COOLING RACK<|>The chicken is placed on a cooling rack to cool<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>The chicken is placed on paper towels to cool<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>200°F OVEN<|>The chicken is kept warm in a 200°F oven<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
