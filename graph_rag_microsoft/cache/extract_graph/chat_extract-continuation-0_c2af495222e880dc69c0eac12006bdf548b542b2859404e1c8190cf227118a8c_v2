Place two cake pans side by side on one rack and the third on the other. Stagger the cake layers on the oven racks so that no layer is directly over another. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until firm to the touch. Monitor the layers carefully for doneness; each one may be done at a different time. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the pans and unmold the cakes onto wire racks to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes, before frosting. The cakes can be kept frozen, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 3 weeks. Defrost them at room temperature before unwrapping. Frost immediately.\nTo make the icing: In a medium stainless-steel bowl, combine the unwrapped caramels, 2 tablespoons of the cream, and the 2 tablespoons butter. Place over a saucepan filled with 2 inches of simmering water. Stir the caramel mixture until smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat. Let cool, stirring the mixture every few minutes until cool to the touch, about 20 minutes. (If the mixture is too warm, it will melt the buttercream frosting when it is stirred in later.)\nWhile the caramel is cooling, make the butter cream: Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the 1 1/2 cups butter on medium-high speed for about 1 minute, until pale in color. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream and the vanilla and powdered sugar, and beat for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the mascarpone and beat on medium-low speed until incorporated. Do not overbeat the mascarpone, or it may separate. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooled caramel mixture to drizzle over the cake once it is frosted. Stir the remainder of the caramel into the frosting, using large strokes to create caramel swirls throughout. Don't stir it too much or the ribbons of caramel will disappear.\nPlace one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a thick blanket of frosting on top. Add the second layer and spread thickly with frosting. Add the third layer and cover the top and sides of the cake with an even layer of frosting. Use a small spoon to drizzle the reserved 1/\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of spice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake is a type of baked good)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Batter is a mixture of ingredients used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a device used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pans are containers used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rack is a device used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE PANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake pans are specialized pans used for baking cakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire racks are devices used for cooling baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROSTING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frosting is a topping used for baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caramels are a type of sweet treat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWDERED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Powdered sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mascarpone is a type of cheese used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVING PLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Serving plate is a device used for serving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spoon is a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
