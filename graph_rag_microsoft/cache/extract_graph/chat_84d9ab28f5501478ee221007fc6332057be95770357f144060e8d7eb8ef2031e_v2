Be careful not to burn them.\nPut the toasted walnuts in a blender, add the cider and a large pinch of salt, and pulse until a loose, grainy paste is formed. Remove the pesto from the blender and set it aside.\nSplit the cabbage in half, remove the core, and cut each half into 4 wedges. Slice the wedges into thin strips.\nMelt the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat, and sauté the onion until it just begins to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the cabbage and a few pinches of salt, and stir well to coat with the butter.\nAdd the broth and bring to a lively simmer. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until the cabbage is tender.\nRemove the pot from the heat and stir in the buttermilk. Return it to very low heat and warm it slowly, stirring as you do, so the buttermilk doesn’t curdle.\nServe the soup in individual bowls with a tablespoon of the black walnut pesto in the center of each serving.
