Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. 3. In a large bowl, mash together the banana, peanut butter, applesauce, and vanilla with the back of a fork. Whisk in 1/3 cup water, scrape the sides, and mix well.\nAdd the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir together until just combined. Stir in the oats and chocolate chips.\nUse a small ice cream scoop or spoon to drop ping pong ball–size dollops of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. They don’t spread much, so they only need 1/2 inch of space between the cookies. Bake for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned on the bottom. Let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before devouring. You can freeze baked cookies in a gallon-size freezer bag for up to 3 months.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5e4389a4d255353e419a7d70239ede278e49f9e860c0893d945090f34932050b_v2"}
