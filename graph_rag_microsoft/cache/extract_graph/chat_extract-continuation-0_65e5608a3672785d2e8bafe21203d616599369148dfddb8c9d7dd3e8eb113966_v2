Use a pastry wheel to trim the edges so they are flush with the edges of the pan. Cover the baking sheet with greased plastic wrap (I use nonstick spray) and let the dough rise in a warm place for 30 to 35 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F / 175°C, with a rack in the middle.\nMeanwhile, peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice crosswise 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick (see Pro Tip).\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Uncover the dough and sprinkle it evenly with half the cinnamon sugar. Arrange the apple slices across the dough (see Pro Tip). Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon sugar evenly over the apples. Finish with the salt.\nBake the tart until the edges of the crust are golden brown, the apples are tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife, and the sugar has caramelized, 32 to 36 minutes. Cool the tart for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving, warm or at room temperature.\nThis tart is best the same day it's made. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>GEO<|>A baking sheet is a flat, rectangular pan used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used to make baked goods)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PASTRY WHEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pastry wheel is a tool used to trim the edges of dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is a type of wrapping material used to cover baked goods)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An oven is a device used for baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rack is a device used to support baked goods in the oven)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a sweetener used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cinnamon is a spice used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used in baking)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>DOUGH<|>The baking sheet is used to hold the dough during baking<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>APPLES<|>The dough is used to hold the apples during baking<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>APPLES<|>SUGAR<|>The apples are sprinkled with sugar during baking<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SUGAR<|>CINNAMON<|>The sugar and cinnamon are mixed together during baking<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CINNAMON<|>SALT<|>The cinnamon and salt are sprinkled over the apples during baking<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SALT<|>APPLES<|>The salt is sprinkled over the apples during baking<|>8)\n##\n##"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
