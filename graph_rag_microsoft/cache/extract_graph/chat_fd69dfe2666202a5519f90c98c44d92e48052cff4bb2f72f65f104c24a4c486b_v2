Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Perform entity recognition\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            ents.append(ent)\n    \n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Blood Orange and Poppy Polenta Shortbread Cookies\")\n\n# Get the entities\nentities = custom_entity_recognition(doc)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor ent in entities:\n    print(f\"('entity'<|>{ent.text.upper()}<|>{ent.label_}<|>{ent.text} )\")\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all relationships among the identified entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform relationship extraction on the text.

Lightly butter an 8x8\" baking pan, preferably metal. Line with parchment paper, creating overhang on 2 sides. Lightly butter parchment. Whisk polenta, salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Place granulated sugar and blood orange and lemon zests in a large bowl and rub together with your fingers until mixture is very fragrant and sugar starts to look a little moist, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup butter and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add vanilla and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold dough with a rubber spatula a few times to incorporate any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl. The dough will be wet and a bit sticky.\nUsing floured hands, gently press half of the dough into prepared pan in an even layer. Sprinkle 2 Tbsp. poppy seeds over dough; press gently to adhere. Scatter pieces of remaining dough over and press down into an even layer with floured hands. For a completely flat surface, use the bottom of a straight-sided measuring cup to smooth dough.\nBake shortbread until edges are golden brown and center is light golden, 25–30 minutes. Let cool in pan.\nMeanwhile, simmer blood orange juice in a small saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until reduced to 2 Tbsp., 10–12 minutes. Pour into a small bowl and let cool.\nCarefully slide a small knife or offset spatula along sides of pan not lined with parchment paper, then use edges of paper to lift out shortbread onto a cutting board.
