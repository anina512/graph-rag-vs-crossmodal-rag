Line large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk self-rising flour and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl. Using fingertips, rub in chilled butter until pieces are size of small peas. Add dried wild blueberries and toss to coat. Mix 1 cup buttermilk and finely grated lemon peel in glass measuring cup. Pour buttermilk mixture into dry ingredients and stir until dough begins to form (some of flour will not be incorporated). Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and gather together. Knead dough briefly, about 5 turns. Divide dough in half. Form each dough half into ball and flatten into 1-inch-thick disk. Cut each disk into 6 wedges.\nTransfer scones to prepared baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar. Bake until scones are golden brown on top and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MEYER LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Meyer Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED BLUEBERRY<|>EVENT<|>Dried Blueberry is a type of dried fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCONES<|>EVENT<|>Scones are a type of baked good made with the ingredients in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>EVENT<|>Baking sheet is a type of cooking vessel used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEYER LEMON PEEL<|>EVENT<|>Meyer Lemon Peel is a type of citrus peel used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTERMILK<|>EVENT<|>Buttermilk is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-RISING FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Self-Rising Flour is a type of flour used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsalted BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted Butter is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED WILD BLUEBERRIES<|>EVENT<|>Dried Wild Blueberries are a type of dried fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Recipe is a collection of instructions and ingredients used to make the scones)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEYER LEMON<|>DRIED BLUEBERRY<|>Meyer Lemon and Dried Blueberry are used together in the recipe<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEYER LEMON<|>SCONES<|>Meyer Lemon is used in the recipe for Scones<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIED BLUEBERRY<|>SCONES<|>Dried Blueberry is used in the recipe for Scones<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAK"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
