Add the chicken and turn to coat fully in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 45 minutes before frying.\nLine a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. In a large, shallow bowl, combine the flour, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, Cajun seasoning, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and roll it around in the seasoned flour until completely covered. Set it on the prepared baking sheet; repeat with the remaining chicken. Dip the coated chicken pieces once more in the marinade, then again in flour. Return the pieces to the baking sheet (a few minutes' rest makes for a sturdier, crisper coating).\nHave a wire cooling rack set over paper towels ready. In a large, heavy Dutch oven, heat 1 1/2 inches of oil over medium heat until it reaches 350°F on a deep-fat thermometer. Using kitchen tongs, add a few chicken pieces at a time to the hot oil (crowding will lower the temperature, making for greasy chicken). Fry the chicken until the internal temperature reaches 180°F, about 10 minutes per side (watch carefully, it can easily burn). Transfer the cooked chicken to the wire rack. Serve immediately or at room temperature (don't let the chicken sit more than 2 hours).\nThe chicken can be fried up to 2 days in advance, covered, and refrigerated. Serve it cold-a classic Texas picnic food-or reheat on wire racks set on baking sheets in a 375°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.\nIf the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DOUBLE-DIPPED BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Double-Dipped Buttermilk Fried Chicken is a recipe for cooking chicken in a buttermilk marinade and then frying it in oil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTERMILK<|>PERSON<|>Buttermilk is a dairy product used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>PERSON<|>Thyme is a herb used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABASCO SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Tabasco sauce is a condiment used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Worcestershire sauce is a condiment used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>PERSON<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Black pepper is a spice used in the marinade for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>PERSON<|>All-purpose flour is used to coat the chicken before frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAJUN SEASONING<|>PERSON<|>Cajun seasoning is a spice blend used to coat the chicken before frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Olive oil is used for frying the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Vegetable oil is used for frying the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>PERSON<|>Aluminum foil is used to line a baking sheet for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE COOLING RACK<|>PERSON<|>A wire cooling rack is used to cool the fried chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>PERSON<|>Paper towels are used to absorb excess oil from the fried chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP-FAT THERMOMETER<|>PERSON<|>A deep-fat thermometer is used to measure the temperature of the oil"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
