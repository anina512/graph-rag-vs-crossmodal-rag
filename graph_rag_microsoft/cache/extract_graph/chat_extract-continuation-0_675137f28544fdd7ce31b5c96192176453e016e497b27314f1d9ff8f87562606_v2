Butter one 10-cup soufflé dish or six 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to coat. (If using 1 1/4-cup dishes, place all 6 on rimmed baking sheet.) Combine crab, shrimp, roasted peppers and tarragon in processor; chop finely, using on/off turns.\nMelt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, shallot and cayenne. Cook without browning until mixture begins to bubble, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, then wine. Cook until smooth, thick and beginning to boil, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix yolks and salt in bowl. Add yolk mixture all at once to sauce; whisk in quickly. Stir in crab mixture. Using electric mixer, beat whites in large bowl until stiff but not dry. Fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm soufflé base to lighten. Fold in 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, then remaining whites. Transfer soufflé mixture to prepared dish.\nPlace soufflé in oven. Bake soufflé until puffed, golden and gently set in center, about 40 minutes for large soufflé (or 25 minutes for small soufflés). Using oven mitts, transfer soufflé to platter and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
