Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead a couple of times or so until no wet spots remain (be careful not to overwork or doughnuts will be tough).\nRoll out dough to 1/4\" thick, sprinkling surface and/or dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Punch out as many rounds as you can with 3 1/4\" cutter, then use 1 1/4\" cutter to punch out center of each round. Gather doughnut holes and scraps and re-roll; repeat process until all dough has been used (3–4 times; you should have 8 doughnuts).\nFit a medium saucepan with thermometer. Pour in oil to come 4\" up sides of saucepan and heat over medium until thermometer registers 325°F. Working in batches, fry doughnuts until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack lined with paper towels and let cool slightly.\nWhisk together 1 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon matcha until no lumps remain.\nWhisk together 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon matcha until no lumps remain.\nWhisk together 1 large egg white, 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons matcha, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon water until smooth.\nToss still-warm doughnuts in Matcha Sugar Topping or Sweet Matcha Powder or dip in Matcha Glaze.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_019575b20e61d8a96b02ba4098faa087b5e6a701437ccbccf6471742afba5ba5_v2"}
