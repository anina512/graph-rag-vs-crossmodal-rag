Put the red onion slices in a small glass bowl and pour the hot liquid over them. Set aside to steep and cool for at least 1 hour.\nPut the steaks in a resealable plastic bag and pack the blue cheese around them. Push as much air as you can from the bag and zip it closed. Refrigerate the steaks for 12 hours or overnight.\nIn a large skillet set over medium-high heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter and, when bubbling hot, sear the mushrooms until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. In a glass mixing bowl, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, truffle oil, and ginger. Add the scallions and browned mushrooms. Stir to mix and coat the mushrooms with the marinade. Set aside at room temperature while you prepare the steaks.\nRemove the steaks from the bag and scrape off the blue cheese. Pat them dry with paper towels. Season both sides of the steaks with the garlic powder and salt and pepper and set them aside to come to room temperature.\nPreheat the oven to 400°F.\nHeat a large, heavy, oven-safe skillet—I like an old cast-iron pan with character—over medium-high heat and, when hot, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter.
