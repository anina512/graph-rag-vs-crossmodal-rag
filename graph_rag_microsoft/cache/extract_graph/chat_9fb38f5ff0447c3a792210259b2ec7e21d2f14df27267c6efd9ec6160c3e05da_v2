Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify the entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Relationship extraction**: Identify the relationships between the entities.\n5. **Entity and relationship formatting**: Format the entities and relationships according to the required output format.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform the above steps:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = [\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"GEO\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"resides_in\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"PERSON\", \"resides_in\"),\n]\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Blood Orange and Coconut Marshmallows\"\n\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Extract entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}')\")\n\n# Extract relationships\nrelationships = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    for rel in relationships:\n        if ent.label_ == rel[0] and ent.text in [r[1] for r in relationships]:\n            source_entity = ent.text.capitalize()\n            target_entity = [r[1] for r in relationships if r[0] == ent.label_ and r[1] == ent.text][0].capitalize()\n            relationship_description = f\"{ent.text} is {rel[2]} of {target_entity}\"\n            relationship_strength = 1\n            relationships.append(f\"", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763459016, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2262, "total_tokens": 2774, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
