Bring 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in a pot over high heat. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water for 6–8 minutes. Check often to see when the potatoes are cooked through; they should be crunchy, still firm and not mushy. Once they’re done, remove the potatoes from pot (but do not dump the boiling water; save it for blanching the carrots) and shock them immediately in the ice water bath for 2 minutes, or until they are completely cool to the touch. Strain and set aside cooked potatoes in a fresh bowl.\nNext, blanch the carrots by repeating the steps as for the potatoes, checking for nonmushy doneness. If you use baby carrots, they take about 4–5 minutes to blanch. Adjust time accordingly for the type of carrots you’re using and how they’re cut. Cook, shock, strain, then set aside with the potatoes.\nChicken can be served immediately, but it will be most flavorful if cooled down, stored, and covered overnight in the fridge, and then reheated and served the next day. Blanched potatoes and carrots can also be stored overnight.\nWhen ready to serve (not long before—just right when you are ready to serve), add carrots and potatoes to the hot chicken curry.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entities and their corresponding information.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n            entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n    return entities\n\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\ntext = \"the chicken through; just brown and sear. The lime leaves will fill your kitchen with their incredible citrus scent—a pretty amazing smell.\"\nentities = extract_entities(text, entity_types)\nprint(entities)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between the entities. We'll use a simple approach to identify related entities, such as entities that appear together in the text.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            if entities[i][1] in entities[j][3] or entities[j][1] in entities[i][3]:\n                source_entity = entities[i][1]\n                target_entity = entities[j][1]\n                relationship_description = f\"{source_entity} and {target_entity} are related\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n                relationships.append((\"relationship\", source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    return relationships\n\nrelationships = extract_relationships(entities)\nprint(relationships)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine the entities and relationships\n\nWe'll combine the entities and relationships into a single list.\n\n```python\ndef combine_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships):\n    combined_list = entities + relationships\n    return combined_list\n\ncombined_list = combine_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships)\nprint(combined_list)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Format the output\n\nWe'll format the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
