Put the ball in the bowl of oil, and repeat with the rest of the dates, adding more oil to the bowl as needed to keep the date balls covered. Set aside.\nPut the lentils in a saucepan, add 6 cups (1.4 kilograms) cold water, and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook the lentils for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring them from time to time.\nMeanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water. Taste a lentil. When they have started to soften but are still firm in the center, drain them in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse them with cold water, and submerge them in the bowl of cold water until ready to use.\nRemove the tough outer celery stalks and reserve them for another use. Pinch off the leaves from the inner stalks and place the leaves in a bowl of ice water. Cut the stalks into 1/8-inch dice; you need 1 cup (120 grams). Put the diced celery in a small bowl, toss with the olive oil and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.\nOnce the soup has reduced, add the lentils; keep warm over low heat.\nWhisk together the flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl and let sit at room temperature until foamy and bubbling, about 10 minutes.\nWhisking constantly, add the flour mixture to the soup, then stir with a flat-bottomed wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot, as you bring the soup to a simmer over medium heat. (High heat could cause the flour to stick to the bottom of the pot.) Simmer the soup gently, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt, remove the soup from the heat, and stir in the lemon juice.\nDrain and dry the celery leaves. Using 2 soupspoons, form the celery salad into a quenelle or football shape and place toward the rim of each soup bowl. Stack about 8 date balls alongside each quenelle. (If you end up with extra date balls, keep them in the refrigerator and add them to salads.)\nCarefully ladle the soup around the garnishes so that a bit of the celery salad and the date balls remain visible. Drizzle some of the olive oil that remains in the bowl of celery salad over the soup and garnish with the celery leaves.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DATE BALLS<|>EVENT<|>Date balls are a garnish for the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWL OF OIL<|>EVENT<|>Bowl of oil is used to cover the date balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>EVENT<|>Saucepan is used to cook the lentils)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH STRAINER<|>EVENT<|>Fine-mesh strainer is used to drain the lentils)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWL OF COLD WATER<|>EVENT<|>Bowl of cold water is used to submerge the lentils)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>EVENT<|>Celery is used as a garnish for the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used to toss with the celery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>EVENT<|>Parsley is used to toss with the celery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LENTILS<|>EVENT<|>Lentils are used to make the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUP<|>EVENT<|>Soup is the main dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAST<|>EVENT<|>Yeast is used to make the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is used to thicken the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used to make the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY LEAVES<|>EVENT<|>Celery leaves are used as a garnish for the soup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>EVENT<|>Lemon juice is used to season the soup)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATE BALLS<|>BOWL OF OIL<|>Date balls are covered in the bowl of oil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATE BALLS<|>CELERY SALAD<|>Date balls are garnished with the celery salad<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATE BALLS<|>SOUP<|>Date balls are served with the soup<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BOWL OF OIL<|>DATE BALLS"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
