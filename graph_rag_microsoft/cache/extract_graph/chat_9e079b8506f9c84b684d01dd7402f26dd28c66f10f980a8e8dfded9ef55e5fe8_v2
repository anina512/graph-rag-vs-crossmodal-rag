Line 2 rimless baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse almonds and oats in a food processor until coarse meal forms. Set aside.\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add both sugars and honey; whisk until blended and sugar dissolves, 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat. Add nut mixture, flour, and salt; stir until well blended.\nSpoon batter by 2-teaspoon portions onto baking sheets, spacing 2 1/2\" apart. Using your fingertips, pat cookies down to 1/4\"-high rounds; push in any jagged edges to form smooth circles. Bake, rotating sheets after 6 minutes, until dark golden brown and cookies spread out into a thin layer, 10-12 minutes. Slide cookies on parchment onto a wire rack and let cool.\nUsing a pastry brush, brush half of each cookie with melted chocolate. Let stand until the chocolate is set, about 2 hours.
