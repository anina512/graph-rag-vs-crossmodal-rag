Bake shell until sides are set and edge is golden, about 20 minutes. Carefully remove weights and foil and bake until shell is golden all over, about 15 minutes more. Cool shell completely in pan on a rack. (Leave oven on.)\nBeat together cream cheese, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and mix in ricotta, whole egg and egg white, and salt until just combined.\nPour filling into cooled tart shell and bake until slightly puffed along edges and just set in center, about 15 minutes. (Center will tremble when tart is gently shaken.) Transfer to a rack and cool completely. Loosely cover tart with plastic wrap and chill until filling is firm, at least 8 hours.\nBring water, wine, sugar, vanilla bean (if using), and zest to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Stir figs into syrup and simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer figs with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Stir apricots into syrup and simmer until tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer apricots with slotted spoon to bowl with figs. Stir cherries into syrup and simmer until just tender, about 1 minute, then add to fruit using slotted spoon.\nBoil syrup until reduced to about 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Discard lemon zest and vanilla bean (if using; if using extract, stir in now), then pour syrup over fruit and cool to room temperature. Serve compote with tart.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>CHILL<|>EVENT<|>Chill shell for 45 minutes)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>FOIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Foil is used to line the shell)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>PIE WEIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pie weights are used to fill the shell)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is used to bake the shell)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream cheese is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cinnamon is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RICOTTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ricotta is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole egg is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg white is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is used to make the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>TART SHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tart shell is used to hold the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric mixer is used to mix the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bowl is used to mix the filling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is used to make the syrup)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wine is used to make the syrup)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla bean is used to make the syrup)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>LEMON ZEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon zest is used to make the syrup)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
