Rub 4 tablespoons butter over breast meat under skin. Place turkey on rack set in large roasting pan. Tuck wing tips under. Tie legs together loosely to hold shape. Rub remaining 3 tablespoons butter over outside of turkey. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nPlace turkey in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Roast turkey 1 hour; pour 1 cup chicken broth over turkey. Roast 1 hour, basting once with pan drippings. Pour 1 cup chicken broth over turkey. Roast until thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175°F, basting once with pan drippings and covering turkey loosely with foil if browning too quickly, about 1 hour longer. Transfer turkey to platter; cover loosely with foil. Let turkey rest 20 to 30 minutes (internal temperature of turkey will increase 5 to 10 degrees).\nPour pan juices into large measuring cup. Spoon fat off top of pan juices and discard. Return pan juices to roasting pan; add gravy base. Place roasting pan over 2 burners and bring gravy to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until gravy is reduced to 31/4 cups, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits, about 15 minutes. Season gravy to taste with salt and pepper. Strain gravy into bowl.\nServe turkey with gravy.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fad24d1b14a45003858651eab9beef5eb877cfc524d087adc19b69dc533d5eae_v2"}
