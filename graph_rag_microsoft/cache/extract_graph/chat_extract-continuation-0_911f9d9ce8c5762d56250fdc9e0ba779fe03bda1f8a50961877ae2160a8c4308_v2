Meanwhile, bring an inch or two of water to a boil in a small pot. Whisk together the egg yolks, crème fraîche, Parmesan, and garlic in a large heatproof bowl that will fit snugly in the pot without making contact with the boiling water.\nSet the bowl in the small pot and whisk the egg mixture constantly, occasionally scraping the sides and removing the bowl from the pot every couple of minutes as you whisk to keep the cooking nice and slow (don't let it bubble). The mixture will look thick and clumpy for a few seconds, then become liquidy, and then, once the cheese has melted, silky smooth. Cook just until the liquidy sauce has thickened slightly (it should thinly coat the back of a spoon), 6 to 8 minutes. Set the bowl aside in a warm place.\nSalt the large pot of boiling water generously until it tastes slightly less salty than the sea. If you're confident that the pasta and asparagus will finish cooking at the same time, add them both to the water. If you're a worrywart, cook the asparagus first, scoop it into a colander to drain, then cook the pasta. Cook the asparagus until it is juicy with a slight bite, 3 to 4 minutes; and cook the pasta until it is fully cooked, 3 to 4 minutes.\nDrain the pasta and asparagus well in a colander, then pop them back into the now-empty pot. Pour in most of the fonduta and toss gently but well. Season to taste with salt and more fonduta, if you'd like. Transfer to bowls, top with a little more Parmesan, and eat straightaway.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TAGLIATELLE<|>EVENT<|>Tagliatelle is a type of pasta dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPARAGUS<|>EVENT<|>Asparagus is a key ingredient in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN FONDUTA<|>EVENT<|>Parmesan Fonduta is a key component of the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>EVENT<|>Egg yolks are used in the Parmesan Fonduta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>EVENT<|>Crème fraîche is used in the Parmesan Fonduta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Parmesan cheese is used in the Parmesan Fonduta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is used in the Parmesan Fonduta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH EGG PASTA<|>EVENT<|>Fresh egg pasta is used in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPARAGUS TIPS<|>EVENT<|>Asparagus tips are used in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPARAGUS STALKS<|>EVENT<|>Asparagus stalks are used in the Tagliatelle dish)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAGLIATELLE<|>ASPARAGUS<|>Asparagus is a key ingredient in the Tagliatelle dish<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAGLIATELLE<|>PARMESAN FONDUTA<|>Parmesan Fonduta is a key component of the Tagliatelle dish<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>Egg yolks and crème fraîche are used in the Parmesan Fonduta<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGG"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
