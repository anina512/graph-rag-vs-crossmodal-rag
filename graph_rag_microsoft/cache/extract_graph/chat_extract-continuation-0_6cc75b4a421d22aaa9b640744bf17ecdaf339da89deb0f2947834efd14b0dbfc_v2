Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nPop out the stems of the mushrooms and discard. Wipe the mushroom caps clean with a damp paper towel and place round side down on the prepared baking sheet and set aside.\nCombine the bread crumbs, nutritional yeast, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the oil in a bowl.\nUsing a teaspoon measure, stuff each mushroom cap with a heaping mound of the bread crumb filling. Lightly drizzle the mushrooms with the remaining oil. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.\nThe mushrooms can be cleaned and stemmed, and the bread crumb filling made, up to a day in advance and stored in airtight containers in the fridge.
