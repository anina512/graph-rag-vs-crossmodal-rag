Spoon remaining stuffing into a small baking dish and cover with foil, then set aside. Tie legs together with string and arrange poussins, without crowding, on rack in pan. Brush melted butter generously over poussins, reserving remainder for basting.\nRoast poussins, basting occasionally, until deep golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and roast until a thermometer inserted into a thigh (avoiding bone) registers 180°F, and into the stuffing, 165°F, about 10 to 20 minutes more. Transfer poussins to a platter, reserving pan, and loosely cover with foil. Reheat reserved stuffing in oven while making jus.\nRemove rack from pan and tilt pan so fat and juices accumulate in one corner. Carefully spoon off almost all of fat. Straddle pan across 2 burners; add broth and water and deglaze pan by boiling over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Transfer to a 1- to 2-quart saucepan and simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 3 minutes. Stir cornstarch mixture; stir into sauce and simmer 1 minute. Add lemon juice; season with salt and pepper to taste, then pour jus through a fine-mesh sieve into a gravy boat. Cut off string and serve poussins with jus and additional stuffing.\n*Available at kalustyans.com.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Pepper is a type of spice used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BIRDS<|>GEO<|>Birds are the subjects of the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUSSINS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Poussins are young chickens used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>String is used to tie the legs of the poussins together)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is used to brush the poussins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The oven is used to roast the poussins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A thermometer is used to check the temperature of the poussins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUFFING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stuffing is a mixture used to fill the body cavity of the poussins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jus is a sauce made from the pan drippings of the poussins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is used to add flavor to the jus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornstarch is used to thicken the jus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KALUSTYANS.COM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kalustyans.com is a website where the recipe is available)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEPPER<|>BIRDS<|>Pepper is used to season the birds<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BIRDS<|>POUSSINS<|>Poussins are a type of bird<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUSSINS<|>STRING<|>String is used to tie the legs of the poussins together<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>POUSSINS<|>Butter is used to brush the poussins<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVEN<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
