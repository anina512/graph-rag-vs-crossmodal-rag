DO AHEAD: The dough can be made ahead and stored, wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator, up to 2 days or frozen, up to 1 week; defrost in the refrigerator before proceeding.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch round then transfer to a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Trim the edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang, then fold the overhang under and crimp the edge decoratively. Using a fork, prick the bottom and sides of the pie shell all over then chill for 30 minutes.

Fill the pie shell with pie weights or dried beans and bake until the pastry is set and pale golden along the edge, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Carefully remove the weights or beans and the foil and bake the shell until pale golden all over, 8 to 10 minutes more. Brush the entire pastry surface with the lightly beaten egg yolk, and cool completely.\nArrange a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350°F.\nIn a large bowl, combine the pecans, chocolate, and flour, and toss to combine.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and brown sugar and beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.
