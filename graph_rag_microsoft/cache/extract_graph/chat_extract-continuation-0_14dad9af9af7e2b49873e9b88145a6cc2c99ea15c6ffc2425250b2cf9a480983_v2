Combine the masa mix and warm water in a medium bowl, mixing until a soft dough forms. You can use a wooden spoon for mixing, but you will have better results if you use your hands. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until it is smooth.\nIf the dough seems dry, add more water, a tablespoon at a time, as necessary.\n2. To form the tortillas, one at a time, pinch off small handfuls (about 3 tablespoons) of the dough and roll each one between the palms of your hands into a ball. Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth as you form them, to keep them from drying out.\n3. Cut a quart-size resealable plastic bag open down both sides, to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line a tortilla press as you shape the tortillas, so they do not stick: Lay one side of the plastic over the bottom of the press, place a ball of dough in the center, and fold the other side of the plastic over the dough. Shut the top of the tortilla press firmly down on the dough to shape the tortilla. (See Note.)\n4. Heat a griddle until hot. Place a tortilla on the griddle and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Using a spatula, flip it over and continue to cook, flipping it occasionally, until both sides are covered with small brown spots. Transfer to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm while you cook the remaining tortillas, stacking the finished tortillas on the plate. Serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HOMEMADE CORN TORTILLAS<|>EVENT<|>Homemade Corn Tortillas is a recipe for making corn tortillas at home)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORN MASA MIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corn masa mix is a type of flour used to make corn tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WARM WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warm water is a necessary ingredient for making corn tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wooden spoon is a tool used to mix the masa mix and warm water)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLoured SURFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A floured surface is a tool used to knead the dough)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC BAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A plastic bag is a tool used to line a tortilla press)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TORTILLA PRESS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tortilla press is a tool used to shape the tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A griddle is a tool used to cook the tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A kitchen towel is a tool used to keep the tortillas warm)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person who may be making the homemade corn tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE<|>PERSON<|>Meggie is a person who may be making the homemade corn tortillas)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE<|>PERSON<|>Durke is a person who may be making the homemade corn tortillas)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>HOMEMADE CORN TORTILLAS<|>CORN MASA MIX<|>Homemade Corn Tortillas uses corn masa mix as an ingredient<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>HOMEMADE CORN TORTILLAS<|>WARM WATER<|>Homemade Corn Tortillas uses warm water as an ingredient<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>HOMEMADE CORN TORTILLAS<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>Homemade Corn Tortillas uses a wooden spoon to"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
