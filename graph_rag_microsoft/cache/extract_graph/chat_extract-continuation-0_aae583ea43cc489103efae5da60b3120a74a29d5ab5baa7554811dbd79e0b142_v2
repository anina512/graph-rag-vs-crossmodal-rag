Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; discard bean. Transfer white chocolate mixture to large bowl; gradually add mascarpone, whisking until mixture is smooth. Cool mascarpone mixture until barely lukewarm.\nUsing electric mixer, beat 1 cup cream in medium bowl until peaks form. Fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture in 4 additions. Cover and chill white chocolate mousse until set, about 3 hours. DO AHEAD: Pears and mousse can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.\nCut pears lengthwise in half and remove cores and stems; cut halves lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.\nArrange ladyfingers, rounded sides down, in single layer in bottom of 12-cup trifle dish (about 8 inches in diameter and 5 inches deep), covering bottom completely (using about 15 ladyfingers). Drizzle 5 tablespoons pear syrup evenly over ladyfingers. Using small offset spatula, spread 1/3 of white chocolate mousse over ladyfingers, making layer slightly thicker around outer edges of dish to allow mousse to be more visible (center of mousse layer will be thin). Starting at outer edges of dish, place pear slices in single layer with curved edges against sides of dish atop mousse, covering completely. Repeat layering of ladyfingers, syrup, mousse, and pears 2 more times. Cover with fourth layer of ladyfingers (some ladyfingers and pear slices may be left over). Drizzle ladyfingers evenly with 5 tablespoons syrup. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate trifle and remaining pear syrup separately.\nUsing electric mixer, beat 2 cups whipping cream in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add 1/4 cup pear syrup and beat until stiff peaks form. Working in batches, transfer cream to large pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe rosettes all over top of trifle, mounding slightly in center. Sprinkle with crystallized ginger. Garnish with chocolate curls. DO AHEAD: Can be made 6 hours ahead. Keep refrigerated.\nSift powdered sugar over trifle just before serving.\n* Mascarpone is an Italian cream cheese; sold at many supermarkets and at Italian markets.\n** Available in the bakery or bread section of some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White chocolate is a type of chocolate that is made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mascarpone is an Italian cream cheese that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pears are a type of fruit that are used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADYFINGERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ladyfingers are a type of sponge cake that are used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAR SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pear syrup is a sweetener made from pears that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CURLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate curls are a type of chocolate decoration that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISTALIZED GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crystallized ginger is a type of ginger decoration that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla bean is a type of spice that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIFLE DISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trifle dish is a type of serving dish that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric mixer is a type of kitchen appliance that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASTRY BAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pastry bag is a type of kitchen tool that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR TIP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Star tip is a type of kitchen tool that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWDERED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Powdered sugar is a type of sweetener that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is not mentioned in the text, so I assume it is not a person in this context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
