Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt', '½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into (½\") pieces', '2 large egg yolks', '1¼ cups (packed; 250 g) light brown sugar', '½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 8 equal pieces', '¾ cup heavy cream', '2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt', '½ cup tahini', '1 tsp. vanilla extract', '6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65%–75% cacao), coarsely chopped', 'Toasted sesame seeds (for serving)']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat a 9x9\" or 8x8\" baking pan, preferably metal, with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Whisk flour, powdered sugar, sesame seeds, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your hands, work in butter until pieces are about pea-size. Using a rubber spatula, mix in yolks. (Dough should hold together when squeezed.)\nScrape dough into prepared pan and gently press into an even layer (lightly flour your hands if needed). Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this will help it stay flat as it bakes).\nBake shortbread until golden brown, 24–28 minutes (or up to 35 minutes if using a glass dish). Let cool slightly.\nWhile the shortbread is cooling, heat brown sugar and butter, whisking constantly, in a heavy medium saucepan over medium until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until butterscotch is thick enough to coat a spoon (bubbling will become less frequent), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add tahini and vanilla and whisk until incorporated and smooth.\nPour butterscotch over shortbread and tilt pan to distribute evenly. Chill until set, 30–40 minutes\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
