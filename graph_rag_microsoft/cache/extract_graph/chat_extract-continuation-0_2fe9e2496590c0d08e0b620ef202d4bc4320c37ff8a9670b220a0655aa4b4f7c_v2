Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. If using parchment paper, lightly coat it with vegetable oil or cooking spray.\n2. With an electric mixer, beat together the confectioners' sugar, dark brown sugar, butter, and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in the vanilla.\n3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat the flour mixture into the peanut butter mixture a small amount at a time.\n4. Using a 1-tablespoon/15-milliliter measuring spoon or equal capacity ice cream scooper, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, placing each cookie about 1 1/2 inches/4 centimeters apart. Roll the dough between your palms and make a dip with your thumb in each. Fill each dip with 1/2 teaspoon jam or jelly.\n5. Bake the cookies until light golden, about 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through the baking time. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and cool completely before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>QUINOA PB&J COOKIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Quinoa PB&J Cookies is a recipe for a type of cookie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKING SPRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cooking spray is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Confectioners sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARK BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dark brown sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Creamy peanut butter is a type of peanut butter used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pure vanilla extract is a type of extract used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINOA FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Quinoa flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a type of powder used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRAWBERRY JAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strawberry jam is a type of jam used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAPE JELLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grape jelly is a type of jelly used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric mixer is a type of mixer used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Medium bowl is a type of bowl used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>1-TABLESPOON MEASURING SPOON<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
