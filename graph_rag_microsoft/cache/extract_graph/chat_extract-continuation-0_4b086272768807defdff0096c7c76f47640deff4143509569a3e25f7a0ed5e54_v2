Identify all entities.

Using on/off turns, chop into small pieces. Transfer chopped apples to large saucepan. Repeat chopping remaining apples in 2 more batches in processor; add to saucepan. Place all dried fruit in processor. Using on/off turns, chop until beginning to stick together. Add dried fruits to saucepan with apples. Add sugar, molasses, rum, brandy, cornstarch, butter, orange peel, lemon peel, spices, and sea salt; stir to blend. Simmer over medium-low heat until mixture is very thick, stirring often to prevent scorching, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer pie filling to large bowl and cool completely, about 1 hour.\nPosition rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 375°F. Transfer 1 crust to 9-inch glass pie dish, leaving dough overhang. Spread cooled filling in crust. Cut second crust into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 6 dough strips atop filling, spacing 1 inch apart. Place 6 dough strips at 45-degree angle to first strips, forming diamond lattice pattern. Trim strip ends even with bottom crust.
