Do not let them brown. Remove them with a draining spoon and set aside. Melt the lard in the pan, add the potatoes, and sprinkle them with pepper. The bacon may contribute enough salt. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the lardons and continue to cook, uncovered, over low heat, tossing or stirring often, until the potatoes are tender and some are browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Don't worry if some of them are crushed, as they will help hold the mixture in a cake.\nStir in the cheese, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Press down on the potatoes to level them in the pan. Turn the heat to high and let them cook without stirring until the bottom is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Press on the cake occasionally to hold it together. When done, it should be brown around the edges and starting to pull from the sides of the pan. Take the pan off the heat, run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake, and turn it out onto a warmed platter. Serve hot.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>POTATO CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon is a dish made with potatoes, cheese, and bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BACON<|>EVENT<|>Bacon is a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Cheese is a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>POTATO<|>EVENT<|>Potatoes are a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BACON LARDONS<|>EVENT<|>Bacon lardons are a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LARD<|>EVENT<|>Lard is a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Vegetable oil is a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CANTAL CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Cantal cheese is a type of cheese used in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRUYÈRE CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Gruyère cheese is a type of cheese used in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>10-INCH FRYING PAN<|>EVENT<|>A 10-inch frying pan is used to cook Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>10-INCH NONSTICK FRYING PAN<|>EVENT<|>A 10-inch nonstick frying pan is used to cook Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>25-CM FRYING PAN<|>EVENT<|>A 25-cm frying pan is used to cook Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>25-CM NONSTICK FRYING PAN<|>EVENT<|>A 25-cm nonstick frying pan is used to cook Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>5-OUNCE BACON<|>EVENT<|>5-ounce bacon is a key ingredient in Potato Cake with Cheese and Bacon)\n## (\"entity\"<|>140-GRAMS BACON<|>EVENT<|>140-grams bacon is"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
