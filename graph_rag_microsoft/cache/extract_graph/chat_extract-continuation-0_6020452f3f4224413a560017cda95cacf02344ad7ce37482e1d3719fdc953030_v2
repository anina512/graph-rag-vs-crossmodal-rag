Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don’t worry).\nRemove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Gently stir in the black beans and salt. Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary. Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.\nIn a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.\nIn a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water. Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, and salt. Process until the dressing is nice and smooth. The dressing should be zippy, but if it’s unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.\nCombine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl. Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed. (If you won’t be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you’d like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)\nWhen you’re ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra). Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.\nArrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side). Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta. Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad. Serve immediately.\nIf you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later. Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Code\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    entities = defaultdict(list)\n    for entity_type in entity_types:\n        if entity_type == 'organization':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'person':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'geo':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'event':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid entity type: {entity_type}\")\n        \n        matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n        for match in matches:\n            entity_name = match.capitalize()\n            entity_description = f\"{match} is a {entity_type}\"\n            entities[entity_type].append((entity_name, entity_description))\n    \n    return entities\n\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for i in range(len(entities[entity_type])):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(entities[entity_type])):\n                source_entity = entities[entity_type][i][0]\n                target_entity = entities[entity_type][j][0]\n                relationship_description = f\"{source_entity} and {target_entity} are related\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n                relationships.append((source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    \n    return relationships\n\ndef format_output(entities, relationships):\n    output = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for entity in entities[entity_type]:\n            output.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity[0]}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity[1]}')\")\n    for relationship in relationships:\n        output.append(f\"('relationship'<|>{relationship[0]}<|>{relationship[1]}<|>{relationship[2]}<|>{relationship[3]}')\")\n    return '##'.join(output) + '##<|COMPLETE|>'\n\ntext = \"\"\"\nreduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.
