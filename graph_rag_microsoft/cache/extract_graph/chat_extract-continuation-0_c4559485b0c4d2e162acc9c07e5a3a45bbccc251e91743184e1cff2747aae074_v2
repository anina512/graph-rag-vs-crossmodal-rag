In a food processor, pulse sugar-flour mixture 10 seconds; add sliced butter; pulse until dough pieces are the size of peas, 1 minute. Add buttermilk; pulse a few more times until just combined. Use a 1/3-cup measure to portion dough into 10 round biscuits; place on top of fruit. Lightly press biscuits with fingers to flatten tops; sprinkle cobbler with raw sugar. Bake until juices bubble thickly and biscuits are golden brown, 50 minutes.
