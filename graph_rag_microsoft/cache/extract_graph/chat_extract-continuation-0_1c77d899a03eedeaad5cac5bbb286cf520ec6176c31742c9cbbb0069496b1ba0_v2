Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. It’s important to add the flour and water little by little like this, so that your batter does not have too much weight thrown on it and that you allow each amount of flour and water to completely mix into the batter. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and beat just until combined.\nUsing a spatula, fold the grated apple into the batter. Take care not to overmix the batter. If you overmix the batter, the cupcakes will not be light and fluffy but instead very dense.\nUse a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the cups are two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. After 5 minutes, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely for approximately 20 minutes. It’s always best to cool the cupcakes at room temperature. Putting them in the refrigerator to cool can dry out the cake.\nPlace all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed at the very end for at least 2 minutes to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy.\nPour the sugar and water into a large saucepan. Heat on medium-high heat and stir constantly until the sugar completely liquefies. Stir constantly and be careful not to burn the sugar. After all the sugar has dissolved, add the butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and mix thoroughly. Once the butter has melted and the butter and sugar are completely mixed, remove from heat and, using a whisk, slowly whisk in the heavy cream until you reach a beautiful golden brown caramel color. Set aside and let cool and thicken for 5 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to thicken further before you use to fill or decorate.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of fat used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of powder used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a type of liquid used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a type of fruit used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ICE-CREAM SCOOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ice-cream scoop is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toothpick is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>REFRIGERATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refrigerator is a type of appliance used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Saucepan is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHISK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whisk is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a type of liquid used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bowl is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric mixer is a type of appliance used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PADDLE ATTACHMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paddle attachment is a type of utensil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Cupcakes are a type of"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
