Shuck the corn and use a paring knife to strip the kernels into a bowl. Put the cobs in a pot with 4 cups water; bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, put the butter or oil in a saucepan and turn the heat to medium-high. When the butter melts or the oil is hot, add the onion and potatoes, along with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens, about 5 minutes; add the tomatoes if you're using them and cook, stirring, for another minute or two.\n3. After the corn cobs have cooked for at least 10 minutes, strain the liquid into the onion-potato mixture. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down so the mixture simmers. When the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes, add the corn kernels and milk and heat through. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, garnish with the parsley, and serve.\nSTRIP THE KERNELS from the cob with a sharp knife, and make sure to catch any liquid that seeps out during the process.\nTO MINIMIZE COOKING TIME, chop the potatoes into 1/4-inch pieces. Leave them larger if you're not in a hurry.\nAS LONG AS your corn is young and tender, the kind you can just about eat raw, the kernels should be held out of the mix until the chowder is just about ready, so they don't overcook. But the new supersweet hybrids, which retain much of their flavor in the refrigerator for a few days, are not as tender, and their kernels should be cooked for a few minutes at least. Just keep tasting and stop cooking when the texture seems right.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>THE MINIMALIST'S CORN CHOWDER<|>EVENT<|>The Minimalist's Corn Chowder is a recipe for a delicious corn-based dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>THE MINIMALIST<|>PERSON<|>The Minimalist is the author of the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>THE MINIMALIST<|>PERSON<|>The Minimalist is the author of the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORN<|>GEO<|>Corn is a type of food that is used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Onion is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>POTATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Potato is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepper is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Milk is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parsley is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>THE MINIMALIST<|>THE MINIMALIST'S CORN CHOWDER<|>The Minimalist is the author of the recipe<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CORN<|>THE MINIMALIST'S CORN CHOWDER<|>Corn is a key ingredient in the recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>THE MINIMALIST'S CORN CHOWDER<|>Butter is used in the recipe<|>6)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OIL<|>THE MIN"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
