Mix toasted coconut, egg whites, oil, sugar, and salt with a rubber spatula in a large bowl until combined and the consistency of a stiff paste.\nTransfer coconut mixture to tart pan. Using your hands, press mixture evenly onto bottom and up sides of pan. Bake crust until edges are lightly brown and bottom is set and just barely golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let crust cool.\nDo Ahead: Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Wrap with plastic and store at room temperature.\nSprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Let sit 10 minutes.\nCombine jelly and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add bloomed gelatin and mix to combine. Add rhubarb, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until rhubarb is lighter pink in color and slightly softened, 2–4 minutes depending on thickness of stalks. Mix in lemon juice. Turn off heat and let rhubarb come to room temperature in syrup (about 1 hour). Strain cooled rhubarb through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; reserve syrup.\nWhisk chilled custard until creamy. Spoon custard into tart shell; smooth with an offset spatula.\nScatter rhubarb in an even layer over custard. Pour 1/4 cup rhubarb syrup over fruit, tilting pan to evenly distribute. Chill 20 minutes, then repeat with 1/4 cup rhubarb syrup. Chill tart at least 3 hours and up to overnight before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COCONUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coconut is a type of fruit used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg whites are a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUBBER SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rubber spatula is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TART PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tart pan is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic is a type of material used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GELATIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gelatin is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JELLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jelly is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rhubarb is a type of fruit used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Custard is a type of dessert used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Syrup is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH SIEVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fine-mesh sieve is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFSET SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Offset spatula is a type of kitchen tool used in"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
