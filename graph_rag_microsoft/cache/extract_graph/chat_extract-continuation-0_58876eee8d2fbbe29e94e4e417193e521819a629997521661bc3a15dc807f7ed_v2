Standard blender jars probably won’t fit all the ingredients so blend in batches. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher. Add sugar (or your preferred sweetener) to taste, adjusting for your own preference and based on how sweet the fruit is to begin with. Add enough ice to your liking. As an option, you can garnish with a piece of an ingredient in the agua. For example, a sprig of rosemary, a stick of cinnamon, or slices of lemon.
