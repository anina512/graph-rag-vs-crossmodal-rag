Cover with parchment and let cool, or chill overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Grease cake pan with butter and line bottom with parchment paper.\nToast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 6–8 minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl.\nPulse 1/2 cup dry ingredients and 3/4 cup hazelnuts in a food processor until hazelnuts are chopped into a fine flour; reserve remaining hazelnuts. Transfer chopped hazelnuts to bowl with dry ingredients.\nWipe out food processor bowl and add 5 poached pears. Pulse until smooth. Transfer 2 cups to a small bowl; discard leftover purée.\nBeat brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, and 3/4 cup butter on medium-high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until light and fluffy, 3–5 minutes. Scrape down bowl and add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nAdd half of pear purée and beat on low speed. Add half of flour mixture and beat on low to incorporate. Beat in remaining pear purée and flour mixture until combined. Pour into prepared pan; smooth top.

Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool.\nTurn chilled pears in liquid to coat, then transfer liquid (about 1/2 cup) to a small saucepan. Add chocolate and 3/4 cup cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring, just until chocolate is melted. Whisk to combine, then transfer to a medium bowl. Chill, stirring occasionally so chocolate doesn't set, until room temperature, about 10 minutes.\nRemove cake from pan, trim top with a serrated knife if domed, and invert onto a 12\" platter. Remove parchment. Using a toothpick, poke holes all over top of cake. Using a pastry brush, brush top with 1/4 cup chocolate sauce.\nMeanwhile, coarsely chop remaining 1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts.
