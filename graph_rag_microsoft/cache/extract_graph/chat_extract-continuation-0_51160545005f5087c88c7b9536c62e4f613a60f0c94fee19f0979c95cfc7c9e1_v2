Add cauliflower and cook, stirring occasionally, until just beginning to brown and soften, 5–8 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and cook, stirring, until onion and cauliflower are cooked through, 5–7 minutes more. Add curry powder, salt, and cumin. Cook, stirring, until spices are toasted, about 30 seconds.\nAdd broth and bring to a boil. Add chickpeas, couscous, and lentils, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally to avoid couscous from sticking, until couscous and lentils are cooked through and liquid is almost completely reduced to a thick sauce, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, juice 1 lime to yield 3 Tbsp. juice. Whisk lime juice, yogurt, and 3 Tbsp. chopped cilantro in a medium bowl until smooth. Add water by the tablespoonful until sauce is thin enough to drizzle. Cut remaining lime into wedges.\nFold spinach into chickpea mixture. Top with cilantro leaves and almonds, if using, and serve yogurt sauce and lime wedges alongside.\nStew (without spinach) can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Reheat and fold in spinach before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
