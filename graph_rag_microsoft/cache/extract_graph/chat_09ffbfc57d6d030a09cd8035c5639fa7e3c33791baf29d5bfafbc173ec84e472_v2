Add broth and porcini mushrooms. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced by half (about 2 1/2 cups), about 1 hour. Strain mushroom broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pressing down on solids; discard solids.\nHeat remaining 3 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium. Whisk in flour and cook, whisking often, until flour begins to smell nutty, about 4 minutes. Whisking vigorously to prevent lumps, add mushroom broth and increase heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°F. Combine fennel, onions, 1 Tbsp. butter, and 1 cup water in a small saucepan; season with kosher salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high, cover, and reduce heat. Simmer until fennel and onions are crisp-tender, 5–8 minutes. Uncover; cook until liquid evaporates, 15–18 minutes. Let cool.\nHeat remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over medium. Cook thyme sprigs and mushrooms, tossing occasionally, until mushrooms are browned and tender, 6–8 minutes. Let cool; pluck out thyme.\nDivide fennel mixture and mushrooms among ramekins. Spoon gravy over top. Divide dough in half. Working with one at a time, roll out to 1/4\" thick. Cut out 2 rounds about 1/2\" wider than the diameter of ramekins. Gather up scraps, reroll, and cut out 2 more rounds (for 8 total).\nWhisk egg, a pinch of kosher salt, and 1 tsp. water in a small bowl. Brush dough with egg wash; place over ramekins, brushed side down. Press firmly around sides to adhere. Brush tops of dough with egg wash; sprinkle with thyme leaves and sea salt. Set pot pies on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crusts are golden brown and domed, 25–35 minutes.\nDough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled. Gravy can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Pot pies (without brushing outside of pastry and topping) can be assembled\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_09ffbfc57d6d030a09cd8035c5639fa7e3c33791baf29d5bfafbc173ec84e472_v2"}
