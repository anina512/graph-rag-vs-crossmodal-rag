Identify all entities.

Repeat with remaining dough.\nFor grocery store look-alikes, score each sheet of dough into twelve 2 1/4-by-4 3/4-inch rectangles and dock with a bamboo skewer or the narrow end of a chopstick (a strictly cosmetic procedure). Otherwise, leave the dough uncut.\nBake until crackers are tawny brown and firm, though your fingertip may leave a faint indentation, about 20 minutes.
