Place the fish sauce, granulated sugar, and crushed red pepper each in their own small bowl and arrange on the dining table.\nBring a 5-quart saucepan of water to a full, rolling boil. Remove it from the heat and immediately add the rice noodles, making sure they are fully submerged in the water. Let the noodles soak for exactly 3 minutes (use a timer), occasionally lifting them up and pulling them apart as necessary with tongs or a long fork to keep the noodles separate and help them soften evenly. Drain the noodles in a large colander and rinse them under cold running water. (If the noodles become sticky and clumped together while standing, rinse them briefly under cold water just before cooking, so that they return to their slippery, firm, toss-able state.)\nIn a small bowl combine the garlic and shallots. Place the shrimp, beaten eggs, bean sprouts, scallion greens, and peanuts each in their own bowl and arrange near the stove. Have ready 1 clean medium bowl for the cooked shrimp and eggs, and arrange a platter for serving near the stove.\nHeat a large wok over high heat until hot but not smoking. Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan. (If at any point during cooking the oil starts smoking, lower the heat.) When the oil is hot, scatter in the shrimp. Cook undisturbed until the shrimp begin to change color and firm up, about 30 seconds. Toss well then continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the shrimp are pink, firm and just cooked through, about 30 seconds longer. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to the clean bowl.\nAdd the eggs and swirl the pan to spread them into a thin layer. Cook the eggs, lifting the sides and tilting the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to pour underneath as you do when making an omelet, until the eggs are mostly set, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>OBJECT<|>A large metal cooking vessel used for stir-frying and other high-heat cooking techniques)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>OBJECT<|>A flat, wide tool used for scraping and flipping food in a pan)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TONGS<|>OBJECT<|>A pair of long, flat tools used for picking up and serving food)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOWLS<|>OBJECT<|>Small containers used for holding and serving food)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COLANDER<|>OBJECT<|>A kitchen tool used for draining liquids from solid foods)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A clear, colorless liquid essential for human consumption and cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TAMARIND PASTE<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A sweet and sour condiment made from the fruit of the tamarind tree)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A sweet, white crystalline substance used as a food additive and sweetener)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FISH SAUCE<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A salty, umami-rich condiment made from fermented fish and salt)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>SUBSTANCE<|>A crystalline mineral used as a seasoning and preservative)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BEAN SPROUTS<|>FOOD<|>Young, edible shoots of the mung bean plant)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIMES<|>FOOD<|>A small, green citrus fruit often used as a garnish or in beverages)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEANUTS<|>FOOD<|>A type of legume commonly used as a snack or in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RICE NOODLES<|>FOOD<|>Thin, flat noodles made from rice flour and water)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>FOOD<|>A pungent, flavorful bulb used as a seasoning and ingredient in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>FOOD<|>A type of onion used as a flavoring and ingredient in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>FOOD<|>A type"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
