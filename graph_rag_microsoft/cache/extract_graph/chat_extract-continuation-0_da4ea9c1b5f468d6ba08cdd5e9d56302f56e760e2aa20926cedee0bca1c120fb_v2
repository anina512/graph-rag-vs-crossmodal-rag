Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.\nTransfer frozen yogurt to an airtight container or a shallow baking pan; cover and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.\nDo ahead: Frozen yogurt can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.\nUsing the tip of a paring knife, score an X in the bottom of each peach. Cook in a large pot of boiling water just until skins begin to peel back where cut, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl of ice water and let cool. Carefully peel peaches, reserving skins.\nBring lemon verbena, Cocchi Americano, sugar, reserved peach skins, and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer until mixture has thickened slightly and looks syrupy, 10–12 minutes.\nAdd peaches, cover saucepan, reduce heat, and gently poach fruit until the tip of a paring knife easily slides through flesh, 12–15 minutes. (Very ripe fruit will take less time to cook.) Using a slotted spoon, transfer peaches to a plate and let cool. Cut into wedges.\nMeanwhile, return poaching liquid to a boil and cook until reduced by half, 15–20 minutes. Let cool, then discard solids.\nScoop frozen yogurt into small glasses or bowls and serve topped with peaches, some reduced poaching syrup, and pistachios.\nDo ahead: Peaches can be poached 3 days ahead. Cover and chill in poaching liquid. Bring peaches to room temperature and reduce poaching liquid just before using.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
