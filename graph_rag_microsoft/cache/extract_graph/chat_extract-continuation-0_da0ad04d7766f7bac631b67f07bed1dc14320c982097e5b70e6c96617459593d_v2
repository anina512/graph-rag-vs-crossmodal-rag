Finely grate the zest from 1 of the limes and place the zest in a bowl (reserve the lime for later). Stir in the salt, pepper, and crushed juniper berries and fennel seeds. Sprinkle the mixture all over the salmon fillets and place them, packed close together, in a small baking dish (a large loaf pan or an 8-inch cake pan will work).\nThinly slice the remaining lime and lay the slices on the fish. Tuck the marjoram sprigs around the fish. Cover the fish with olive oil—you’ll need at least ½ cup, possibly even 1 cup, to submerge it. Bake the fish until it’s just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. (Thinner fillets may take less time—start checking at 10 minutes.)\nRemove the fennel fronds from the bulb and chop enough to make ½ cup. Trim the fennel bulb and thinly slice it on a mandoline or with a very sharp knife. In a bowl, toss the fennel fronds and slices with a pinch of fine sea salt. Juice the zested lime and add juice, to taste, to the fennel. Drizzle the fennel with oil. Serve the salmon and fennel sprinkled with flaky sea salt.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>EVENT<|>Salmon Confit is a dish made with salmon fillets, lime, juniper, and fennel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNIPER<|>EVENT<|>Juniper is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL<|>EVENT<|>Fennel is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON<|>EVENT<|>Salmon is the main ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIME<|>EVENT<|>Lime is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARJORAM<|>EVENT<|>Marjoram is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL BULB<|>EVENT<|>Fennel bulb is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL FRONDS<|>EVENT<|>Fennel fronds are a key ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLETS<|>EVENT<|>Salmon fillets are the main ingredient in Salmon Confit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMON CONFIT INSTRUCTIONS<|>EVENT<|>Salmon Confit is a dish made with salmon fillets, lime, juniper, and fennel)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>JUNIPER<|>Juniper is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>FENNEL<|>Fennel is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>SALMON<|>Salmon is the main ingredient in Salmon Confit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>LIME<|>Lime is a key ingredient in Salmon Confit<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALMON CONFIT<|>MARJORAM<|>Marjoram is a key ingredient"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
