Turn off the heat, but leave the mixture on the hot burner; stir well a few times with a whisk, and set aside.\n4. At this point, the sugar syrup should be close to 260°F/127°C (hard ball stage); when it reaches that temperature, remove it from the heat and carefully pour it into the cornstarch mixture. Stir well with the whisk to combine. Bring everything to a low boil over medium heat. Then reduce the heat to low and cook at a low simmer, stirring frequently with the spatula, until the mixture is thick and gluey and a light golden color, 30 to 45 minutes. Don't turn your back on it! You need to make sure to scrape the bottom of the pan with the spatula every few minutes to prevent scorching and lumps.\n5. Remove the pan from the heat and add the flavorings: stir in the rosewater, pistachios, and food coloring (if using).\n6. Wearing oven mitts, immediately pour the candy into the prepared baking sheet. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the candy to prevent it from forming a skin as it cools. Allow it to cool until it has set and is firm and cool to the touch, 6 to 8 hours.\n7. Gently peel off the plastic wrap. Dust the cutting board with the confectioners' sugar. Run the tip of a paring knife between the candy and the sheet, and gently turn the candy out onto the prepared board.\n8. Place the cornstarch mixture in a medium-size bowl. Generously coat a sharp chef's knife with cooking spray, and use a gentle slicing motion to cut the candy into 1-inch squares. Dredge the pieces in the cornstarch mixture until well coated.\nStore the Turkish delights, layered with wax paper, in an airtight container at cool room temperature for up to 1 month.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COOKING SPRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cooking spray is a product used for cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARING KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paring knife is a type of kitchen knife)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHEF'S KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chef's knife is a type of kitchen knife)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Confectioners' sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WAX PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wax paper is a type of paper used for wrapping and storing food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TURKISH DELIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Turkish delights are a type of candy)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROSEWATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rosewater is a flavoring used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pistachios are a type of nut used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FOOD COLORING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Food coloring is a product used to color food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking sheet is a type of kitchen equipment)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bowl is a type of kitchen equipment)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spatula is a type of kitchen equipment)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHISK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whisk is a type of kitchen equipment)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornstarch mixture is a type of mixture used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar syrup is a type of mixture used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALICIA<|>PERSON<|>Alicia is the person making the Turkish delights)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALICIA'S KITCHEN"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
