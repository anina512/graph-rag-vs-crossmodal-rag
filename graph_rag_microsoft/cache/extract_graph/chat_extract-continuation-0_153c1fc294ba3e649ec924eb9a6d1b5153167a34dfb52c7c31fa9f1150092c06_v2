Remove from heat, then whisk in gelatin mixture until completely dissolved. Transfer to a metal bowl and chill in an ice bath, stirring frequently, until mixture has thickened to consistency of raw egg whites. Remove from ice bath.\nMeanwhile, beat cream with zest until it just holds soft peaks.\nStir one third of whipped cream into yolk mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining cream gently but thoroughly.
