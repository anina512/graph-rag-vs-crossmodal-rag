After about 20 minutes at 375°F, or when the top crust is brown, tent it loosely with foil.\n11. Cool the challah. Remove the pan from the oven and unmold the challah onto a wire rack. Turn it top side up to cool completely.\nTo make the dough in a bread machine with a programmable setting and pause button, after mixing the sponge (Step 1), scrape it into the bread machine container and sprinkle the flour blanket on top, as in Step 2. Add the cold eggs (Step 3) and mix the dough for 3 minutes, then let it proceed through the knead cycle for about 8 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, shiny, and elastic. You will need to pause the machine a few times to scrape out any flour or dough that collects in the corners of the container. Add the softened butter at once and continue the kneading cycle until it is incorporated, about 3 minutes, pausing and scraping down the sides if necessary.\nFor the first rise (Step 4), turn off the machine and let the dough rise (with the lid closed) until approximately doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove the container from the machine, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for 1 hour (Step 5). Return the container to the bread machine (you can leave the plastic wrap in place) and deflate the dough by pressing the mix button and mixing for about 30 seconds. Return the container to the refrigerator for 1 hour. Then proceed from Step 6, deflating and chilling the dough.\n• In a superb article on brioche in Pleasures of Cooking, the cookbook author Paula Wolfert recommends melting and browning about one-fifth of the butter (2 tablespoons) for an extra rich, delicious flavor.\n• On some mixers there may not be an adjustment to raise the bowl, and the dough hook may not work as well for this small amount of dough; if this is the case, use the paddle beater.\n• If after unmolding a brioche loaf the sides are still pale in color, place the loaf directly on the oven rack and continue baking for about 5 minutes to brown the sides and make them firm to prevent collapse.\n• If\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread is a type of baked food made from flour, water, and other ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHALLAH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Challah is a type of bread that is traditionally braided and often served on special occasions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD MACHINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread machine is a device that can be used to mix, knead, and bake bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAULA WOLFERT<|>PERSON<|>Paula Wolfert is a cookbook author who has written about brioche)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLEASURES OF COOKING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pleasures of Cooking is a cookbook that features recipes and articles about cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a device used for baking and cooking food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a device used to cool baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant-read thermometer is a device used to measure the internal temperature of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 1<|>EVENT<|>Step 1 is a process of mixing the sponge for the bread dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 2<|>EVENT<|>Step 2 is a process of sprinkling the flour blanket on top of the sponge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 3<|>EVENT<|>Step 3 is a process of adding the cold eggs to the bread dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 4<|>EVENT<|>Step 4 is a process of letting the dough rise until it is approximately doubled)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 5<|>EVENT<|>Step 5 is a process of refrigerating the dough for 1 hour)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP 6<|>EVENT<|>Step 6 is a process of deflating and chilling the dough)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAD<|>CHALLAH<|>Bread and challah are both types of baked goods<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAD MACHINE<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
