Turn out dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and roll to a 1/4\"-thick rectangle, about 16\"x12\". Cover with plastic and chill until dough is firm, 30–60 minutes.\nSpread butter mixture over two-thirds of dough. Fold plain side over the middle, then fold opposite third over (like folding an envelope). Roll to a 12\"x8\" rectangle about 1/2\" thick. Slice lengthwise into eight 1\"-thick strips.\nWorking one at a time, lay strip on clean work surface with long side facing you. Using your palms, gently twist each end in opposite directions until entire strip is spiraled. Hold one end of strip between a thumb and index finger. Working away from you, tightly wrap strip around 3 fingers. Wrap around fingers again, placing second loop closer to the palm of your hand. As you bring strip across the back of your hand, cross over first loop, angling toward the end of your index finger. Cross dough over front of your hand and tuck the end into the center while removing your fingers and pushing through to the other side to create a knot. Check out step-by-step photos here. You want to twist these tightly so that they rise while baking. If you’re having trouble, twist them into any kind of knot that you can—just make sure it's wrapped tightly.\nDivide cinnamon twists between 2 rimmed baking sheets, spacing evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until doubled in size, 45–60 minutes.\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325°F. Bake cinnamon buns, rotating pans from top to bottom halfway through, until deeply golden brown, 25–30 minutes.\nBring remaining 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan. Generously brush syrup over hot buns. If you like a sweeter pastry, wait 5 minutes, then brush again.\nDo Ahead: Buns can be made 2 days ahead. Tightly wrap with plastic and store at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>sugar is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>tools are necessary for making cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILLING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>filling is a component of cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>dough is a mixture of flour, sugar, and other ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>butter is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>parchment paper is used to prevent dough from sticking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>plastic wrap is used to cover dough and prevent it from drying out)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>butter mixture is a component of cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON TWISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>cinnamon twists are a type of pastry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>baking sheets are used to bake cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>oven is used to bake cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>racks are used to support baking sheets in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>brown sugar is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>water is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>saucepan is used to boil brown sugar and water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>syrup is a component of cinnamon buns)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>buns are a type of pastry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEP-BY-STEP PHOTOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
