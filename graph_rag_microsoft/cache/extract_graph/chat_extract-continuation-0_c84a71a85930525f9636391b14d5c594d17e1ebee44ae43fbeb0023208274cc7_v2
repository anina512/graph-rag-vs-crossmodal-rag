Bake for 5 to 8 minutes or until cookies are puffed and only just barely starting to brown at the edges: Start with the shortest amount of time and watch carefully, especially with very small cookies. As the cookies are fragile right out of the oven, let cool slightly before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.\nWhen cool, glaze and decorate as desired.\nMakes up to 6 dozen cookies, depending on the size. This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.\nWhisk the egg white and salt until loosened and beginning to foam. Add oil, confectioners' sugar, and cream gradually and whisk, adding more sugar and cream until the glaze is of spreading consistency: You want it to be thin enough to spread easily over the cookies to their edges, but not so thin it runs off the sides.\nUsing an offset spatula or a smooth table knife, spread the glaze over each cookie, filling in the shape to its edges. While the glaze is wet, you can decorate the cookies with colored sprinkles, or leave the glaze plain, let dry, and add more decoration with Royal Icing.\nBefore you start, make sure that all utensils and containers are clean and grease-free. Have ready several small containers for dividing the icing and tinting it with different colors, if desired. You will need to keep the royal icing covered with a damp cloth, plastic wrap, or tight fitting lid or it will dry out. Royal icing will keep, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for about one week. This recipe is proportioned for the firmest-textured icing; adjust the texture with the addition of water or sugar as explained below.\nIf using egg whites, combine the egg whites, cream of tartar, and sugar and beat until the icing is thick and holds billowy peaks, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired.\nIf using meringue powder, whisk the meringue powder and sugar together in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the water and beat on low speed for about 5 minutes, until icing is thick and holds billowy peaks. Don't overbeat or the icing texture will become hard to work with. Add glycerin for extra shine, if desired. To adjust the consistency of icing: To thicken, add sifted confectioners' sugar\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Cookies are baked in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>EVENT<|>Cookies are placed on a wire rack to cool completely)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>Glaze is spread over the cookies using an offset spatula or a smooth table knife)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROYAL ICING<|>EVENT<|>Royal icing is used to decorate the cookies)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITE<|>PERSON<|>Egg white is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>PERSON<|>Cream is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Confectioners sugar is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>GEO<|>Wire rack is used to cool the cookies)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>Oven is used to bake the cookies)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TABLE KNIFE<|>GEO<|>Table knife is used to spread the glaze)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OFFSET SPATULA<|>GEO<|>Offset spatula is used to spread the glaze)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CONTAINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Containers are used to hold the ingredients)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Electric mixer is used to mix the ingredients)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPRINKLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sprinkles are used to decorate the cookies)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROYAL ICING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Royal icing is used to decorate the cookies)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>COOKIES<|>WIRE RACK<|>Cookies are placed on a wire rack to cool completely<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>COOKIES<|>GLAZE<|>Glaze is spread over the cookies<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GLAZE<|>ROYAL ICING<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
