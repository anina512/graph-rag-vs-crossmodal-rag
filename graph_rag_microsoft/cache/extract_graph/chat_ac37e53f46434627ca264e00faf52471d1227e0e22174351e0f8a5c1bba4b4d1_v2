Lightly knead, grabbing corners of dough, gently pulling upward, and pushing toward the center, until dough comes together. Dust another bowl with all-purpose flour and transfer dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 12–18 hours.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface, dust with flour, and press into a 8x5\" rectangle. Fold rectangle in half lengthwise, then roll up tightly at narrow end (like a burrito). Place both hands on top of dough; working against friction of work surface, pull gently down toward yourself to create a rounded boule shape.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and cover loosely with a clean flour-dusted towel. Let rise at room temperature 4 hours, or chill 6–12 hours.\nOne hour before baking, arrange rack in middle of oven; preheat to 500°F. After dough has risen, slash dough with a razor blade or very sharp knife in 3 parallel slits at least 1/4\" deep. Transfer baking sheet to oven, reduce oven temperature to 450°F, and bake bread until crust is very brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 190–200°F, 30–40 minutes. Let cool before slicing, about 2 hours.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ac37e53f46434627ca264e00faf52471d1227e0e22174351e0f8a5c1bba4b4d1_v2"}
