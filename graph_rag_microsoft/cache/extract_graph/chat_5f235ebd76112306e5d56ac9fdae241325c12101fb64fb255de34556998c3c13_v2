Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem statement.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]:\n            ents.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Casônsèi from Val Camonica\\nIngredients:\\n['2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting', '3 eggs', '1 tablespoon olive oil', '1 pound 2 ounces potatoes, diced', '14 ounces Swiss chard, stalks removed', '3 tablespoons butter', '1 garlic clove, finely chopped', '1 sprig chopped fresh parsley', '1 leek, chopped', '7 ounces Italian sausage, skinned and chopped', '3/4 cups bread crumbs', 'Generous 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese', '1 egg, lightly beaten', 'Salt and pepper', '4 tablespoons butter, melted', '2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese']\\nInstructions:\\nMake the pasta dough.

Identify all entities.
