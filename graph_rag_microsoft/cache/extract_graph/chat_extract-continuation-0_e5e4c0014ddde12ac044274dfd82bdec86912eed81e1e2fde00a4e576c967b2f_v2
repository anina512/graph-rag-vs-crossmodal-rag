Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data, including the ability to extract information that is hidden in unstructured text.\n\n2. **Entity Type Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to extract relationships.\n\n4. **Relationship Strength Scoring**: Use a machine learning model to score the strength of each relationship.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nBlack Bean Soup with Roasted Poblano Chiles\n\nIngredients:\n['2 poblano chiles', '2 tablespoons raw shelled pumpkin seeds (pepitas)', '1 large dried pasilla or ancho chile, stemmed, seeds removed', '1 tablespoon vegetable oil', '1 medium onion, coarsely chopped', '4 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed', '1 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted or plain diced tomatoes', '4 cups low-sodium chicken broth', 'Kosher salt', '2 14.5-ounce cans black beans, drained', '1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco or feta', 'Lime wedges (for serving)']\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat broiler.
