Add the duck breasts, seal, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking.\nPreheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. In a large ovenproof sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Sear the duck breast, skin side down, for 5 minutes; turn and sear for 5 minutes on the other side. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer the duck breasts to a plate and keep warm.\nTo make a balsamic jus, pour off the fat from the pan. Return the pan to medium-high heat, add the wine, and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook to reduce the wine by half. Add the balsamic vinegar and cook to reduce for several more minutes.\nCut the duck breasts into diagonal slices and serve drizzled with the balsamic jus.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PAN-SEARED FIVE-SPICE DUCK BREAST WITH BALSAMIC JUS<|>EVENT<|>Pan-Seared Five-Spice Duck Breast with Balsamic Jus is a recipe for a dish that combines the flavors of five-spice powder, balsamic vinegar, and red wine)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>PERSON<|>Duck breast is a type of meat used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC JUS<|>EVENT<|>Balsamic jus is a sauce made from balsamic vinegar and red wine, served with the duck breast)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FIVE-SPICE POWDER<|>PERSON<|>Five-spice powder is a spice blend used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Olive oil is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RED WINE<|>PERSON<|>Red wine is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>PERSON<|>Balsamic vinegar is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>BALSAMIC JUS<|>The duck breast is served with the balsamic jus<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>FIVE-SPICE POWDER<|>The duck breast is seasoned with five-spice powder<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>GARLIC<|>The duck breast is marinated with garlic<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>GINGER<|>The duck breast is marinated with ginger<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>OLIVE OIL<|>The duck breast is cooked in olive oil<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK BREAST<|>RED WINE<|>The duck breast is cooked with red wine<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
