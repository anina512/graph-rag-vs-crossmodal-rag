Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text.

Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nTo make the dough: Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and cream together until fluffy. Add the Quark, grated lemon peel, vanilla extract, and rum; beat until well combined.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and baking powder. Add to the Quark mixture and beat together until just combined. Briefly beat in the almonds and raisins.\nUsing your hands, pinch off golf ball–size pieces of dough and, without overhandling them, form them into 2-inch/5cm ovals or blocks. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 inch/2.5 cm between them. Place one baking sheet in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the Stollen bites are a pale golden brown.Meanwhile, make the topping: Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Place the confectioners’ sugar and Vanilla Sugar in a small bowl and whisk to combine.Remove the Stollen bites from the oven and slide in the second batch. Let the finished bites cool briefly, just until you can handle them. Dip each bite into the melted butter, and then toss in the confectioners’ sugar mixture and place back on the baking sheet to set.
