We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity.

Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Roll belly around loin so the short ends of the belly meet. If any of the belly or loin overhangs, trim meat.

Preheat oven to 500°F. Season porchetta with salt. Roast on rack in baking sheet, turning once, for 40 minutes. Reduce heat to 300°F and continue roasting, rotating the pan and turning porchetta occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat registers 145°F, 1 1/2-2 hours more. If skin is not yet deep brown and crisp, increase heat to 500°F and roast for 10 minutes more. Let rest for 30 minutes. Using a serrated knife, slice into 1/2\" rounds.\n1. Set belly skin side down. Using a knife, score the belly flesh in a checkerboard pattern 1/3\" deep so roast will cook evenly.\n2. Flip belly skin side up. Using a paring knife, poke dozens of 1/8\"-deep holes through skin all over belly. Don't be gentle! Keep poking.\n3. Using the jagged edge of a meat mallet, pound skin all over for 3 minutes to tenderize, which will help make skin crispy when roasted.\n4.
