Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball–rolling party!\nOptional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.\nAdd at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 350°F over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil’s too hot or you’re frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you’re frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.\nRemove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack. Plate and top with spicy aioli and more aioli on the side to dip.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>EVENT<|>Tofu balls are a food item that can be made and fried)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOFU<|>EVENT<|>Tofu is a food item that can be used to make tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICY AIOLI<|>EVENT<|>Spicy aioli is a condiment that can be used to top tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>EVENT<|>Oil is a substance used for frying tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALLS<|>EVENT<|>Balls are a shape that tofu balls can take)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>EVENT<|>A rack is a tool used to dry tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINER<|>EVENT<|>A container is a tool used to store tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRYING<|>EVENT<|>Frying is a cooking method used to make tofu balls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOFU BALL–ROLLING PARTY<|>EVENT<|>A tofu ball–rolling party is an event where tofu balls are made and eaten)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>TOFU<|>Tofu balls are made from tofu<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>SPICY AIOLI<|>Tofu balls are topped with spicy aioli<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>OIL<|>Tofu balls are fried in oil<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>BALLS<|>Tofu balls are a type of ball<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>RACK<|>Tofu balls are dried on a rack<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>CONTAINER<|>Tofu balls are stored in a container<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>FRYING<|>Tofu balls are made using the frying method<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU BALL<|>TOFU BALL–ROLLING PARTY<|>Tofu balls are made and eaten at a tofu ball–"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
