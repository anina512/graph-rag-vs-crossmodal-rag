Cook or microwave the potatoes in their skins until done. When cool enough to handle, peel. Dice two and mash the other two. Set aside.\n2. Preheat the oven to 350° F.\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and carrot and sauté over medium heat until golden.\n4. Add the broccoli along with a small amount of water. Cover and cook until the broccoli is tender but not overdone, 3 to 4 minutes.\n5. Sprinkle the flour into the skillet, then pour in the milk, stirring constantly. Cook until the liquid thickens a bit, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the diced and mashed potatoes. Heat through gently. Stir in the parsley, if using, and season with salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into the pie crust and pat in.\n6. Place the bread crumbs in a small mixing bowl. Drizzle with the remaining oil and stir until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Sprinkle evenly over the pie. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the crust is golden. Let the pie stand for about 10 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VEGGIE POT PIE<|>EVENT<|>Veggie Pot Pie is a recipe for a savory pie made with potatoes, onion, carrot, broccoli, and bread crumbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGGIE POT PIE<|>EVENT<|>Veggie Pot Pie is a recipe for a savory pie made with potatoes, onion, carrot, broccoli, and bread crumbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POTATOES<|>GEO<|>Potatoes are a type of root vegetable often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>GEO<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used for cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>GEO<|>Onion is a type of vegetable often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROT<|>GEO<|>Carrot is a type of vegetable often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROCCOLI<|>GEO<|>Broccoli is a type of vegetable often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>GEO<|>FLOUR is a type of powder used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>GEO<|>Milk is a type of liquid used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>GEO<|>Parsley is a type of herb often used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>GEO<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>GEO<|>Pepper is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE CRUST<|>GEO<|>Pie crust is a type of pastry used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD CRUMBS<|>GEO<|>Bread crumbs are a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Batag"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
