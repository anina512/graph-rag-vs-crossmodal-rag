Reduce heat and simmer until peaches are barely tender, about 3 minutes.\nRemove jars and lids from water, reserving water in canner, and transfer to a clean kitchen towel, then divide peaches among jars using a slotted spoon. Return peach-cooking liquid to a boil, then pour into jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at top. Run a thin knife between peaches and sides of jars to eliminate air bubbles.\nWipe off rims of filled jars with a dampened kitchen towel, then firmly screw on lids with screw bands. Put sealed jars on rack in canner and, if necessary, add enough hot water to cover jars by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, covered. Boil jars 20 minutes, then transfer with tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal as they cool (if you hear a ping, that signals that the vacuum formed at the top of the jar has made the lid concave).\nAfter jars have cooled 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift off lid with your fingertips. If you can't, the lid has a good seal. Store in a cool dry place up to 6 months. Promptly put any jars that haven't sealed in the refrigerator and use them first.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PEACHES<|>EVENT<|>Peaches are a key ingredient in this recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACH-COOKING LIQUID<|>EVENT<|>Peach-cooking liquid is a byproduct of cooking peaches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARS<|>EVENT<|>Jars are used to store the peaches and peach-cooking liquid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used to cook the peaches and to seal the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNER<|>EVENT<|>Canner is a device used to boil the jars and seal them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>EVENT<|>Kitchen towel is used to wipe off rims of filled jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREW BANDS<|>EVENT<|>Screw bands are used to firmly screw on lids of jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACHES<|>EVENT<|>Peaches are a key ingredient in this recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACH-COOKING LIQUID<|>EVENT<|>Peach-cooking liquid is a byproduct of cooking peaches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARS<|>EVENT<|>Jars are used to store the peaches and peach-cooking liquid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used to cook the peaches and to seal the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNER<|>EVENT<|>Canner is a device used to boil the jars and seal them)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>EVENT<|>Kitchen towel is used to wipe off rims of filled jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREW BANDS<|>EVENT<|>Screw bands are used to firmly screw on lids of jars)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEACHES<|>PEACH-COOKING LIQUID<|>Peaches are cooked in peach-cooking liquid<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEACHES<|>JARS<|>Peaches are stored in jars<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEACH-COOKING LIQUID<|>JARS<|>Peach-cooking liquid is poured into jars<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
