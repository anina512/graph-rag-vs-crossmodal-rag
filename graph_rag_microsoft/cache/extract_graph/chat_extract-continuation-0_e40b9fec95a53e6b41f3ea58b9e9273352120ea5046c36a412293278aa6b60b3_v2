Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken pieces are very soft and beginning to fall apart, adding more water by cupfuls if necessary to keep chicken submerged, about 2 hours 30 minutes.\nStrain soup; discard solids. Return broth to same pot. Boil until reduced to 2 cups, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 3 tablespoons water into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens. Add to hot broth; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Transfer to 13x9x2-inch glass dish. Cover; refrigerate aspic overnight.\nMix 1 cup black vinegar, 6 tablespoons soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons fresh ginger strips in small bowl. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.\nCombine all filling ingredients in large bowl and mix with fork just until blended. Cut aspic into 1/3-inch cubes. Add aspic to pork mixture; stir gently with wooden spoon just until incorporated. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.\nLine 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 dumpling wrapper on work surface. Spoon 1 very generous teaspoon filling onto center of wrapper, including at least 2 or 3 aspic cubes.\nLightly brush edges of dumpling wrapper with water. Bring 1 corner of wrapper up around filling, then pleat remaining edges of wrapper at regular intervals all around filling until filling is enclosed and wrapper forms bundle-like shape with small opening at top.\nGather top edges of wrapper together and twist at top to enclose filling. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. DO AHEAD Can be refrigerated, covered, for 1 day, or frozen in single layer in covered containers for 2 weeks.\nLine each layer of bamboo steamer basket with cabbage leaves; place over wok filled with enough water to reach just below bottom of bamboo steamer basket. (Or line metal steamer rack with cabbage leaves and set over water in large pot.) Place dumplings atop cabbage, spacing apart.\nBring water to boil. Cover; steam until cooked through, adding more water to wok if evaporating too quickly, about 12 minutes for fresh dumplings and 15 minutes for frozen. Serve dumplings immediately, passing sauce alongside for dipping.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken is a type of food that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUP<|>EVENT<|>Soup is a dish that is being prepared in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROTH<|>EVENT<|>Broth is a liquid that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GELATIN<|>EVENT<|>Gelatin is a substance that is used to thicken the broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASPIC<|>EVENT<|>Aspic is a dish that is being prepared in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is a type of ingredient that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK VINEGAR<|>PERSON<|>Black vinegar is a type of ingredient that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Soy sauce is a type of ingredient that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK<|>PERSON<|>Pork is a type of food that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPER<|>PERSON<|>Dumpling wrapper is a type of ingredient that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILLING<|>EVENT<|>Filling is a mixture of ingredients that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CABBAGE<|>PERSON<|>Cabbage is a type of ingredient that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>GEO<|>Wok is a type of cooking vessel that is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>SOUP<|>Chicken is used in the soup recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUP<|>BROTH<|>Soup is made with broth<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BROTH<|>GELATIN<|>Gelatin is used to thicken the broth<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GELATIN<|>ASPIC<|>Gelatin is used to make aspic<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
