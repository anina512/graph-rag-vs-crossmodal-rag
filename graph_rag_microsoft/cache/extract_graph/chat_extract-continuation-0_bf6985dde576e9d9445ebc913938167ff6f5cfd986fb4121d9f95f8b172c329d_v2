(Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender to blend the marinade.) Pour the marinade into a gallon-size plastic bag and toss in the chicken pieces. Marinate the chicken in the fridge for 12 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 425°F.\nRemove the chicken pieces from the marinade and pat them dry with paper towels.\nPour 1/4 inch of oil into a large ovenproof skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, arrange the chicken in the skillet, skin side down. The chicken should fit snugly in one layer. Loosely place a square of parchment on top of the chicken and weight the chicken down with a medium ovenproof skillet or heavy pot. Allow the chicken to cook under the weight of the skillet undisturbed for 20 minutes.\nTake the skillet off the heat and carefully (it will be hot!) remove the top skillet (or heavy pot, if using). Flip the chicken, transfer the skillet to the oven, and roast until thethickest part of the thigh registers 165°F, 25 to 30 minutes.\nIn a glass measuring cup, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, and pepper. The white sauce should be thin and runny. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. You can keep any leftover sauce in the fridge for one week.\nLet the roasted chicken rest for 5 minutes. Arrange it on a platter. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
