Put the flour in a small bowl or ramekin, spoon 3 tablespoons of the hot broth into it, and whisk it to a smooth paste with a fork. Pour the remaining broth into a blender, add 1/4 cup of the crab roe, and liquefy until the roe is completely dissolved in the broth. With the blender running, add the flour paste to the broth.\n5 Return the Dutch oven to the heat and melt the butter over medium-low heat until it's frothy. Add the shallot, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is soft, fragrant, and translucent, but not brown, about 4 minutes. Add the half-and-half, the broth mixture, and 1 tablespoon of the sherry, and cover. When the soup comes to a simmer, turn the heat to low, uncover, and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the soup has reduced by about one-sixth, 12 to 15 minutes.\n6 Add the crab meat and cook for 2 minutes over low heat, stirring to combine. Season the soup with salt and black pepper.\n7 Pour a teaspoon of sherry into each bowl before serving, and garnish each bowl with about 11/2 teaspoons roe and chives, if using. Serve with additional sherry—in a shot glass for each guest, or in a cruet for passing around the table—for those who might want more.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>EVENT<|>Crab broth is a dish made from crab roe and other ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>GEO<|>A 4-quart saucepan or Dutch oven is used to make the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAB ROE<|>EVENT<|>Crab roe is a key ingredient in the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is used to thicken the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOT<|>EVENT<|>Shallot is a key ingredient in the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALF-AND-HALF<|>EVENT<|>Half-and-half is a key ingredient in the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERRY<|>EVENT<|>Sherry is a key ingredient in the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAB MEAT<|>EVENT<|>Crab meat is a key ingredient in the crab broth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIVES<|>EVENT<|>Chives are used as a garnish for the crab broth)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>CRAB ROE<|>Crab broth is made from crab roe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>FLOUR<|>Flour is used to thicken the crab broth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>SHALLOT<|>Shallot is a key ingredient in the crab broth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>HALF-AND-HALF<|>Half-and-half is a key ingredient in the crab broth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>SHERRY<|>Sherry is a key ingredient in the crab broth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>CRAB MEAT<|>Crab meat is a key ingredient in the crab broth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRAB BROTH<|>CHIVES<|>Chives are used as a garnish for the crab broth<|>8)\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
