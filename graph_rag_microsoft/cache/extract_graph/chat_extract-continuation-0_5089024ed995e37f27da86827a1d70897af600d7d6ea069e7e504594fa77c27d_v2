Place turkey, breast side down, on vegetables.\nPlace pan with turkey on rack over unlit portion of grill. Cover grill. Insert stem of instant-read thermometer into hole in hood and maintain temperature as close as possible to 350°F by opening vents to increase temperature and closing vents to reduce temperature. Cook turkey 1 hour. Rotate pan. Using oven mitts, turn turkey, breast side up. Cover grill and continue cooking turkey until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, covering any parts of turkey that are browning too quickly with foil, about 1 1/2 hours longer.\nTransfer turkey to platter. Tent with foil and let rest 30 to 45 minutes (internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees).\nStrain pan juices into large measuring cup, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. Spoon off fat that rises to surface into 1-cup measuring cup and, if necessary, add enough butter to fat to measure 1/2 cup. Add enough chicken broth to degreased juices to measure 4 cups.\nHeat turkey fat in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour. Cook roux until deep golden brown (like dark peanut butter), whisking often, about 20 minutes. Gradually whisk in broth mixture. Boil until gravy thickens enough to coat spoon, whisking often, about 5 minutes. Whisk in vinegar and thyme. Season gravy to taste with coarse salt and pepper.\nServe turkey with gravy.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TURKEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Turkey is a type of bird that is commonly roasted for special occasions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetables are a type of food that are often used as a base for roasting a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grill is a type of cooking device that is often used to cook a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant-read thermometer is a type of device that is used to measure the internal temperature of a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hood is a type of device that is used to cover a grill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vents are a type of device that are used to control the temperature of a grill)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN MITTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven mitts are a type of device that are used to protect the hands from heat when handling a hot turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platter is a type of dish that is used to serve a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEASURING CUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Measuring cup is a type of device that is used to measure liquids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Saucepan is a type of cooking device that is used to make a gravy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of ingredient that is used to make a roux)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Broth is a type of liquid that is used to make a gravy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vinegar is a type of ingredient that is used to add flavor to a gravy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thyme is a type of herb that is used to add flavor to a gravy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
