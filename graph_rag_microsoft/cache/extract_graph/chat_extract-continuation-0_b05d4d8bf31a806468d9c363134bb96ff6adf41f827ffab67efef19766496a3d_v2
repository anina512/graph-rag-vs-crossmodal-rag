Coat cut sides of peaches with sugar, transfer peaches, cut side down, to skillet, and cook until sugar just begins to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven and roast peaches until edge of skin is easy to lift away from flesh (leave skin on), 6 to 7 minutes. Keep peaches warm and leave oven on.\nPat duck breasts dry. Using sharp knife, score skin in 1-inch crosshatch pattern, taking care not to cut through fat into meat below. Sprinkle breasts with salt and pepper.\nIn large, ovenproof skillet over moderately low heat, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil until hot but not smoking. Working in 2 batches (wipe pan clean and add remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil before second batch), sear duck breasts, skin side down, until skin is golden brown and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. As fat is rendered, periodically drain off and reserve. Return all 6 breasts to skillet, skin side up. Transfer skillet to oven and roast breasts to desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes for medium-rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into breasts will read 135F). Keep warm.\nIn small, heavy saucepan over high heat, simmer demi-glace until reduced by 25 percent, about 5 minutes. Stir in butter and keep warm.\nWhile demi-glace is reducing, fry rice: Measure reserved duck fat and add vegetable oil if necessary to make 3 tablespoons. In large, well-seasoned wok or large, deep, heavy skillet over high heat, heat fat until just smoking. Add shallots and stir-fry until translucent, about 1 minute. Add walnuts, rice, parsley, chicken stock, and 1 cup soy-lime emulsion and stir-fry until rice is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and keep warm.\nHolding sharp knife at 45°F angle, cut each duck breast into thin slices. Divide rice among 6 large plates and lay duck slices over each mound. Drizzle each with demi-glace and mound micro greens on top. Sprinkle with chives and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>OBJECT<|>Cast-iron skillet is a cooking vessel used for roasting peaches and searing duck breasts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEACHES<|>FOOD<|>Peaches are a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>FOOD<|>Vegetable oil is a cooking oil used for heating the skillet)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DUCK BREASTS<|>FOOD<|>Duck breasts are a type of meat used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>OBJECT<|>Skillet is a cooking vessel used for searing duck breasts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>OBJECT<|>Oven is a cooking appliance used for roasting peaches and duck breasts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT<|>FOOD<|>Duck fat is a cooking oil used for frying rice)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RICE<|>FOOD<|>Rice is a type of food used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>OBJECT<|>Wok is a cooking vessel used for frying rice)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>FOOD<|>Shallots are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WALNUTS<|>FOOD<|>Walnuts are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>FOOD<|>Parsley is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN STOCK<|>FOOD<|>Chicken stock is a cooking liquid used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SOY-LIME EMULSION<|>FOOD<|>Soy-lime emulsion is a cooking liquid used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DEMI-GLACE<|>FOOD<|>Demi-glace is a cooking liquid used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>FOOD<|>Butter is a cooking fat used in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MICRO GREENS<|>FOOD<|>Micro"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
