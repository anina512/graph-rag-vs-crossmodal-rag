Bring to a boil and cook until grains begin to float on the surface and dance (rice should be almost tender but with a firm, opaque center), about 4 minutes. Drain rice and rinse under cold water. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet. Wash out pot.\nPour 3 Tbsp. shallot oil into clean pot. Swirl in 2 tsp. saffron water; reserve remaining saffron water for serving. Oil mixture should barely coat bottom of pot; add more oil if needed. Season lightly with salt. Lay lavash across pot (it can go up the sides a little, but don’t overlap). Spoon a third of rice over lavash; top with a third of herbs and a third of green garlic. Repeat, alternating layers of rice, herbs, and green garlic to form a mound. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke several holes in rice (without hitting bottom of pot) to let steam escape. Wrap lid with a kitchen towel and cover pot. Cook over medium heat until herbs are slightly darkened, 10–15 minutes.\nReduce heat to medium-low, uncover and pour melted butter evenly over rice. Cover and cook until rice is fragrant and fluffy, 20–30 minutes. Remove from heat; let sit 10 minutes. Taste rice and season with more salt if needed.\nScoop 1 1/2 cups rice into reserved saffron water and toss to color rice. Layer saffron rice with rice in pot, reserved herbs, and crispy shallots. Top with rose petals if using. Break up lavash crust into pieces and serve alongside rice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_73b1bdf4b8afee3169b6d8b7118df189f6a6a10b70e8b610d53302ce0fee483a_v2"}
