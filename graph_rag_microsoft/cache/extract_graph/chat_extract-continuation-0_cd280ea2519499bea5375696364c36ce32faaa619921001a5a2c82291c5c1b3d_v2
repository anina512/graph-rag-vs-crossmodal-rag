Let sit, turning once, until they have released some of their liquid, 20–30 minutes.\nHeat 2 dry large skillets over low (or use 1 skillet and work in 2 batches). Spread 1 side of 4 slices with half of mayonnaise. Set slices, mayo side down, on a cutting board. Mound cheese on slices, pressing down gently to pack onto bread. Top with shallot and close sandwiches. Cook, mayo side down, pressing gently, until bottom sides are golden brown (you should barely hear any sound of sizzling as the bread hits the skillet; low and slow is key), 6–8 minutes. Spread remaining mayonnaise over top slices of bread and carefully turn sandwiches over. Cook until other side is golden brown and cheese is melted, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and carefully pry each sandwich open. Add a thin layer of tomatoes and close back up; slice in half.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GRILLED CHEESE WITH PEAK TOMATOES<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes is a recipe for a dish that combines grilled cheese sandwiches with peak tomatoes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAK TOMATOES<|>EVENT<|>Peak Tomatoes is a type of tomato that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a type of sandwich that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>EVENT<|>Mayonnaise is a condiment that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOT<|>EVENT<|>Shallot is a type of onion that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Cheese is a type of ingredient that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Bread is a type of ingredient that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>EVENT<|>Tomato is a type of ingredient that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher Salt is a type of salt that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Freshly Ground Pepper is a type of pepper that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOURDOUGH BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Sourdough Bread is a type of bread that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTRY-STYLE LOAF<|>EVENT<|>Country-Style Loaf is a type of bread that is used in the Grilled Cheese With Peak Tomatoes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE CHEDDAR<|>EVENT<|>White Cheddar is a type of cheese"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
