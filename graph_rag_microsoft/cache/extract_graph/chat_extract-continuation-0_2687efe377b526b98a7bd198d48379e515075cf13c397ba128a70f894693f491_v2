Let turkey stand at room temperature 1 hour to air-dry the skin before roasting.\nMeanwhile, position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 450°F. Trim 1/4\" from top of 3 garlic heads to expose cloves, then place heads on a sheet of foil. Spoon oil over garlic, then wrap tightly in foil to enclose. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and roast until very soft, about 40 minutes.\nCarefully unwrap garlic, let cool slightly, and squeeze pulp into a food processor. Add mayonnaise and blend until smooth.\nPlace turkey on rack in large roasting pan. Cut remaining 2 garlic heads in half crosswise and stuff cavity of bird with garlic head halves, bay leaves, parsley, and thyme. Loosely tie legs together with kitchen twine. Starting at neck end, slide your hand between skin and breast meat to loosen skin. Rub half of mayonnaise mixture under skin, then half over outside. Season both sides with sea salt and pepper. Turn turkey breast side up and place reserved giblets and neck in pan.\nPlace turkey in 450°F oven, then reduce oven temperature to 350°F and roast 1 hour. Rotate pan, wrap wing tips in foil, and continue roasting until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 160°F, 1–1 1/2 hours more.\nTransfer turkey to a cutting board, reserving turkey drippings and juices in pan, and cover loosely with foil.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the given text. We'll also use the `en_core_web_sm` model, which is a small English model that's suitable for most use cases.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the entities\nentities = []\n\n# Iterate over the entities in the document\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    # Extract the entity name, type, and description\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent._.text\n\n    # Format the entity as a string\n    entity = f\"({entity_type}|<{entity_name}|{entity_type}|{entity_description})\"\n\n    # Add the entity to the list\n    entities.append(entity)\n\n# Print the entities\nprint(\"##\".join(entities))\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll use a simple approach to identify related entities. We'll iterate over the entities and check if any of the entities in the text are related to the current entity. We'll use a simple heuristic to determine if two entities are related: if they appear in the same sentence, they're likely related.\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty list to store the relationships\nrelationships = []\n\n# Iterate over the entities\nfor i in range(len(entities)):\n    # Get the current entity\n    current_entity = entities[i]\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining entities\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n        # Get the other entity\n        other_entity = entities[j]\n\n        # Check if the two entities are in the same sentence\n        if doc[i].sent_id == doc[j].sent_id:\n            # Extract the relationship description\n            relationship_description = f\"The {current_entity.split('|')[1]} and the {other_entity.split('|')[1]} are related because they appear in the same sentence.\"\n\n            # Calculate the relationship strength (a simple heuristic)\n            relationship_strength = 1\n\n            # Format the relationship as a string\n            relationship = f\"({relationship_type}|<{current"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
