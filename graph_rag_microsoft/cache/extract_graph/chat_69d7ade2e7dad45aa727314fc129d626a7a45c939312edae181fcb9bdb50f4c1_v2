Cut lemon in half crosswise and thinly slice 1 half; remove seeds. Set remaining lemon half aside for serving. Grill lemon slices, turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and coarsely chop. Place in a medium bowl.\nUsing long tongs, place clams directly on grill. Carefully transfer to a large bowl as they open. (Try to save as much clam liquor as possible, but some will inevitably spill onto coals.) Let cool.\nRemove clams from their shells and coarsely chop. Transfer clams and any liquor to bowl with lemon and add garlic, parsley, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup oil; season with salt and black pepper.\nDrizzle bread with oil and grill, turning halfway through, until toasted and lightly charred, about 5 minutes.\nTop toasts with clam mixture, some Green Olive Tapenade, then Parmesan, dividing evenly; cut into pieces. Cut reserved lemon into wedges and serve alongside toast for squeezing over.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_69d7ade2e7dad45aa727314fc129d626a7a45c939312edae181fcb9bdb50f4c1_v2"}
