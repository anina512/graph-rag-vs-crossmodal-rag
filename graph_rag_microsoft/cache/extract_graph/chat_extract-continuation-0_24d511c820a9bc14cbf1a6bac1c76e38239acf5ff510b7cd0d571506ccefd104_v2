Press pie crust onto bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom; fold sides in and press to extend sides 1/4 inch above rim of pan. Pierce crust all over with fork. Bake until golden brown, about 24 minutes. Cool completely on rack.\nMeanwhile, grate enough orange peel to measure 1 1/4 teaspoons. Cut off remaining peel and pith from oranges. Slice oranges into thin rounds, then cut rounds crosswise in half. Place orange slices on paper towels to drain slightly.\nCombine mascarpone, cream, sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, cardamom, and orange peel in medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat just until blended and peaks form (do not overbeat or mixture will curdle). Spread filling evenly in cooled crust. Arrange orange slices atop tart in concentric circles; sprinkle with pistachios. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon honey and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>EVENT<|>Mascarpone Tart with Honey, Oranges, and Pistachios is a dessert recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE CRUST<|>EVENT<|>Pie crust is a component of the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGES<|>EVENT<|>Oranges are a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Mascarpone cheese is a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy whipping cream is a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HONEY<|>EVENT<|>Honey is a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CARDAMOM<|>EVENT<|>Cardamom is a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIOS<|>EVENT<|>Pistachios are a key ingredient in the Mascarpone Tart recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>PIE CRUST<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes a pie crust component<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>ORANGES<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes oranges as a key ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>MASCARPONE CHEESE<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes mascarpone cheese as a key ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes heavy whipping cream as a key ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>HONEY<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes honey as a key ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE TART<|>CARDAMOM<|>The Mascarpone Tart recipe includes cardamom as a key ingredient<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MASC"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
