Put the lemon juice into a large bowl. Add the mint and pound with the end of a wooden rolling pin. Add the sugar and salt and continue to crush the mint leaves to release their menthol essence. Leave to macerate for 8 to 10 hours or overnight.\nPour 2 1/2 cups of boiling water over the macerated mint mixture and let stand for a further 12 hours.\nStrain the syrup through a very fine sieve or cheesecloth into a saucepan. Gently bring to a simmer and simmer for a couple of minutes. Pour into warm, sterilized bottles (see p. 125) and seal with screw-caps or corks.\nThis syrup will keep unopened for 4 months, but once opened, it should be stored in the fridge. If you want to keep it longer, it will need to be sterilized in a water bath straight after canning (see p. 125).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Mint Syrup is a recipe for a homemade syrup made from mint leaves, lemon juice, sugar, and salt)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MINT LEAVES<|>EVENT<|>Mint leaves are a key ingredient in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Lemon juice is a key ingredient in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Granulated sugar is a key ingredient in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SEA SALT<|>EVENT<|>Sea salt is a key ingredient in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WOODEN ROLLING PIN<|>EVENT<|>A wooden rolling pin is used to pound the mint leaves in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOILING WATER<|>EVENT<|>Boiling water is used to steep the macerated mint mixture in the Mint Syrup recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>EVENT<|>A saucepan is used to simmer the Mint Syrup mixture)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WARM BOTTLES<|>EVENT<|>Warm, sterilized bottles are used to store the Mint Syrup)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER BATH<|>EVENT<|>A water bath is used to sterilize the Mint Syrup)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRIDGE<|>EVENT<|>The fridge is used to store the Mint Syrup once it has been opened)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>MINT LEAVES<|>Mint Syrup is made from mint leaves<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>LEMON<|>Mint Syrup is made with lemon juice<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>Mint Syrup is made with granulated sugar<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>SEA SALT<|>Mint Syrup is made with sea salt<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MINT SYRUP<|>WOODEN ROLLING PIN<|>Mint Sy"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
