(If you don’t have a blender or food processor, just stir everything together in a bowl—the texture will be different but it will still be delicious.)\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, cheese, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper. Mix together with your hands until just combined—you don’t want tough burgers.\nDivide the meat mixture into four portions and roll each into a ball. Place each ball on a large plate and squish it down into a flat patty. Press your thumb into the center to create a little well. This will help the burgers keep their flat shape.Spray the grill with olive oil and heat it to medium heat. Grill the patties on direct heat for 5 minutes, covered and undisturbed. Flip once, cover, and grill for another 4 to 6 minutes, until cooked through.To assemble the burgers, smear the caramelized onions on the bottom half of each roll or bun. Top with romaine and place a cooked patty on each. Add avocado slices and jalapeño rings, if using. Smear the top halves of the buns with Salsa Ranch Dip, then place them on the burgers and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
