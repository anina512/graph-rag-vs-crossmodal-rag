Trim oxtails and pat dry. Season oxtails with salt and pepper. In a deep heavy ovenproof kettle just large enough to hold oxtails in one layer heat 1 tablespoon butter over moderately high heat until foam subsides and brown half of oxtails on all sides, transferring to a bowl. Brown remaining oxtails in 1 tablespoon butter in same manner and transfer to bowl. Coarsely chop shallots, garlic, carrots, leeks, onion, and celery. Add vegetables to kettle and cook in 1 tablespoon butter over moderately low heat, stirring, until softened.\nArrange oxtails over vegetables and add reduced wine, herbs, and enough broth to just cover oxtails. Bring liquid to a boil and braise oxtails, covered, in middle of oven 3 to 3 1/2 hours, or until meat is very tender but not falling off the bone. Transfer oxtails with a slotted spoon to a bowl and keep warm. Pour braising liquid through a fine sieve into a large saucepan and discard solids. Boil liquid until thick, shiny, and reduced to about 1 3/4 cups and whisk in remaining tablespoon butter.\nServe oxtails and sauce with celery root puree or mashed potatoes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RED WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red wine is a type of wine that is used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURGUNDY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burgundy is a region in France known for producing high-quality red wine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXTAILS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oxtails are a type of cut of beef used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY ROOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Celery root is a type of root vegetable used as an accompaniment to the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASHED POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mashed potatoes are a type of side dish used as an accompaniment to the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepper is a type of seasoning used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shallots are a type of onion used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of vegetable used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carrots are a type of root vegetable used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEEK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leek is a type of onion used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Onion is a type of vegetable used in the recipe for Red-Wine-Braised Oxtails)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
