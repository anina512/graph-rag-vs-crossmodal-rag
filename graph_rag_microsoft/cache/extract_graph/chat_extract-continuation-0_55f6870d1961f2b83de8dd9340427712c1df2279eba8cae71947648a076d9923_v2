Bring chiles, cream, butter, paprika, and kosher salt to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to melt butter (adjust heat if needed to keep mixture from boiling over). Immediately pour into blender and blend on low speed to combine. Increase speed and blend until mixture is thick and emulsified (it should be smooth and spreadable). Transfer nduja to an airtight container; cover and chill until set, 1 1/2–2 hours.\nMeanwhile, place currants in a small bowl. Bring vinegar to a simmer in a small saucepan and pour over currants; let sit until plumped, about 30 minutes. Drain currants.\nSpread nduja onto crackers and top with dill, chives, and pickled currants. Sprinkle with sea salt.\nNduja can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SALMON NDUJA<|>EVENT<|>Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLET<|>EVENT<|>Salmon fillet is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALABRIAN CHILES<|>EVENT<|>Calabrian chiles are a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESNO CHILE<|>EVENT<|>Fresno chile is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsalted BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SMOKE SPANISH PAPRIKA<|>EVENT<|>Hot smoked Spanish paprika is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED CURRANTS<|>EVENT<|>Dried currants are a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE WINE VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>White wine vinegar is a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAWAY CRACKERS<|>EVENT<|>Caraway crackers are a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DILL SPRIGS<|>EVENT<|>Dill sprigs are a key ingredient in the Salmon Nduja with Pickled Currants recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THINLY SLICED CHIVES<|>EVENT<|>Thinly sliced"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
