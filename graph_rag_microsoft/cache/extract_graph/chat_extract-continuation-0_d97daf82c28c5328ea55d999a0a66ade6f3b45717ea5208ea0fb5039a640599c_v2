Singe off any of the spider's body hairs with a crème brûlée torch or butane cigarette lighter.\nDip each spider into the tempura batter to thoroughly coat. Use a slotted spoon or your hands to make sure each spider is spread-eagled (so to speak) and not clumped together before dropping it into the hot oil.\nDeep-fry the spiders, one at a time, until the batter is lightly browned, about 1 minute. Remove each spider from the oil and place it on paper towels to drain.\nUse a sharp knife to cut each spider in two lengthwise. Sprinkle with the paprika and serve. Encourage your guests to try the legs first and, if still hungry, to nibble on the meat-filled mesothorax, avoiding the spider's paired fangs, which are tucked away in the head region.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DEEP-FRIED TARANTULA SPIDER<|>EVENT<|>Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider is a dish made from tarantulas, which are deep-fried in oil and served with tempura batter and smoked paprika)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TEXAS BROWN TARANTULA<|>PERSON<|>Texas Brown Tarantula is a type of tarantula used in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHILEAN ROSE TARANTULA<|>PERSON<|>Chilean Rose Tarantula is a type of tarantula used in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CANOLA OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canola oil is a type of oil used for deep-frying in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used for deep-frying in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TEMPURA BATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tempura batter is a type of batter used to coat the tarantulas in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SMOKED PAPRIKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smoked paprika is a type of spice used to season the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRÈME BRÛLÉE TORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crème brûlée torch is a type of torch used to singe off the spider's body hairs in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTANE CIGARETTE LIGHTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butane cigarette lighter is a type of lighter used to singe off the spider's body hairs in the Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider dish)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DEEP-FRIED TARANTULA SPIDER<|>TEXAS BROWN TARANTULA<|>Deep-Fried Tarantula Spider is made from Texas Brown Tarantulas<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DEEP-FRIED TARANTULA SP"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
