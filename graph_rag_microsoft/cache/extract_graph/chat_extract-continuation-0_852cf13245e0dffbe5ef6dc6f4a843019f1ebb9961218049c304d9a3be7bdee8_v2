Place over (not touching) gently simmering water in the bottom pan and heat, stirring frequently, until completely melted. Remove from the heat and set aside until just cool to the touch. Do not allow it to get too cold or it will begin to harden.\nWhile the chocolate is cooling, place the peanut butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat on medium speed just until softened. Add the slightly warm chocolate and beat until combined. The mixture will be quite stiff, so make sure it is well blended.\nUsing a teaspoon, fill each egg shape with the peanut butter mixture, smoothing the top with a spatula or knife. If you prefer a soft filling, let the eggs rest at room temperature for about 1 hour before serving. If a firmer texture if preferred, place the eggs in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes to allow the filling to harden, then serve.\nStore, in a single later, covered and refrigerated, for up to 3 days.\nMolding Chocolate:\nYou cannot mold tempered chocolate successfully in wood or other porous materials. Nor is glass a good choice. When you pour tempered choccolate into a glass mold, it immediately takes on the temperature of the glass, which if it is too hot or too cold will cause the chocolate to go out of temper. Antique metal molds, with interiors that have been damaged through years of use or the passage of time, are best used as wall decorations. Flexible plastic molds are terrific, but in time they begin to show wear and must be replaced. All of this is my way of saying that firm plastic and polycarbonate molds are the best choices for molding chocolate.\nAlthough you might have heard that coating a mold with fat will make removing the finished product easier, do not try it. It will not help unmold the item; it will only make it greasy. Chocolate, like plaster, retracts as it cools, which ensures that once it has set it will easily pull away from a plastic mold. Remember, chocolate reflects the surface against which it has been molded, so if properly done, the set chocolate will be smooth and shiny. However, the chocolate must be tempered—not simply melted—or it won't release.\nBefore you begin to fill a mold, set up your workspace: Have the tempered chocolate in a bowl.
