Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef custom_entity_recognizer(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Define the entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\"}\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n    \n    # Add the patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n    \n    # Get the matches\n    matches = matcher(doc)\n    \n    # Create a list to store the entities\n    entities = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the matches\n    for match_id, start, end in matches:\n        # Get the entity\n        entity = doc[start:end]\n        \n        # Get the entity type\n        entity_type = nlp.vocab.strings[match_id]\n        \n        # Add the entity to the list\n        entities.append((entity.text, entity_type, entity.text))\n    \n    # Return the entities\n    return entities\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Sake-Braised Mustard Greens with Sesame\")\n\n# Get the entities\nentities = custom_entity_recognizer(doc)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"({entity[0]}<|>{entity[1].upper()}<|>{entity[2]}\")\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity disambiguation and relation extraction on the text.
