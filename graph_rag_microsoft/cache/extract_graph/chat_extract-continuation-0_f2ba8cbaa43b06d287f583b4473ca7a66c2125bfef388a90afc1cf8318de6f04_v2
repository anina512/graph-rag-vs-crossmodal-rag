Place the beets in a large, heavy pot and cover with the broth and juice. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, partially covered, until tender, about 45 minutes. Transfer the beets to a bowl with a slotted spoon. When cool enough to handle, slip off the skins and cut the beets into pieces.\n2. Strain broth through a fine sieve lined with two paper towels and return it to the pot.\n3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium- low heat. Add the apples and sauté until just caramelized, about 10 to 15 minutes.\n4. Purée the cooked beets and sautéed apples together in batches in a food processor, adding some broth through the feed tube. Return the purée to the pot and combine with the broth. Stir in the lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Pass the soup through a strainer, if desired.\n5. Serve the soup hot or cold, dolloped with crème fraîche if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BEET APPLE SOUP<|>EVENT<|>Beet Apple Soup is a recipe for a dish that combines beets and apples)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BEETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beets are a type of root vegetable used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable broth is a liquid used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken broth is a liquid used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple juice is a liquid used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of fat used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon juice is a liquid used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a seasoning used in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crème fraîche is a type of dairy product used as a garnish in the Beet Apple Soup recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n##"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
