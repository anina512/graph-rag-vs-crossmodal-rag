Refrigerate the dough until very firm, at least 3 hours.\nDivide the dough in half, wrap each half in plastic wrap, and refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours or up to 4 days. When firm, roll the dough on a lightly sugared work surface into two 9-inch-long logs.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F. Line 3 baking pans with parchment paper. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch-thick slices. There should be at least 24 cookies. Put the remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar in a bowl. Coat the cookies with the sugar. Place the cookies 2 1/2 inches apart on the prepared pans. Bake the cookies until set and no longer wet looking, 10 to 12 minutes. They will be puffy when you take them out of the oven and will sink as they cool.\nPlace 12 of the cookies, bottom side up, on the work surface. Place a large scoop of ice cream on each. Top with a second cookie, bottom side against the ice cream, and gently press to adhere the sandwiches together. Serve immediately, or freeze until ready to serve. Once frozen, wrap well in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredients are the components used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough is a mixture of ingredients used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WORK SURFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Work surface is a location where the dough is rolled out)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a device used to bake the cookies)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BAKING PANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking pans are containers used to bake the cookies)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>COOKIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cookies are the final product of the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ice cream is a component used in the ice cream sandwiches)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RECIPE<|>EVENT<|>Recipe is the instructions and ingredients used to make the cookies and ice cream sandwiches)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredients are the components used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>DOUGH<|>Ingredients are used to make the dough<|>9)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>WORK SURFACE<|>Dough is rolled out on the work surface<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>OVEN<|>Dough is baked in the oven<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>BAKING PANS<|>Dough is baked in the baking pans<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>COOKIES<|>Dough is used to make the cookies<|>9)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>COOKIES<|>ICE CREAM<|>Cookies are used to make the ice cream sandwiches<|>9)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>COOKIES<|>RECIPE<|>Cookies are the final product of the recipe<|>9)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>RECIPE<|>Ice cream is a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
