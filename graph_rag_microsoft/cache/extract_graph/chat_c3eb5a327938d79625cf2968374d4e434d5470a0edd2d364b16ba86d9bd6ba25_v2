Roast until garlic is very soft, about 45 minutes.\nWhile garlic roasts, heat oil (2 tablespoons) in a 4-to 5-quart heavy pot over medium heat until it shimmers, then cook vegetables, remaining garlic cloves (separated but not peeled), bay leaf, and peppercorns, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in wine and boil until most has evaporated. Add soy sauce and water and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.\nStrain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring cup. If you have more than 4 cups, boil to reduce; if less, add water.\nUnless they are very small, cut potatoes (peeled if desired) into 2-inch pieces. Generously cover with cold water in a 5-quart saucepan and add 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer, uncovered, until just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Reserve 1/3 cup cooking liquid and stir butter and oil into it. Drain potatoes, then return to pan along with reserved liquid and coarsely mash. Season with salt and pepper and keep warm, covered.\nMash roasted garlic to a purée.\nMelt butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and garlic purée and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Slowly add stock, whisking, then simmer 3 minutes.
