Pat tenderloins dry and dredge in spice mixture until evenly coated.\nHeat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Reduce heat to moderate and cook pork, turning occasionally, until meat is browned on all sides and thermometer inserted diagonally into center of each tenderloin registers 145°F, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer pork with tongs to a cutting board (reserve skillet) and let stand 10 minutes.\nWhile pork stands, pour off and discard any fat from skillet, then add pomegranate juice to skillet and boil over moderately high heat until reduced to about 2/3 cup, about 3 minutes (if side of skillet begins to scorch, reduce heat to moderate). Stir together cornstarch and water and whisk into juice, then boil sauce until thickened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.\nRemove from heat and add Sherry vinegar to taste, then swirl in butter until incorporated. Pour sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl and skim off any fat. Season with salt. Slice pork and serve with sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PORK TENDERLOIN<|>EVENT<|>Pork Tenderloin is a dish made with pork tenderloins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POMEGRANATE SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Pomegranate Sauce is a sauce made with pomegranate juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN<|>EVENT<|>Cumin is a spice used in the spice mixture for the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORIANDER<|>EVENT<|>Coriander is a spice used in the spice mixture for the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Black pepper is a spice used in the spice mixture for the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>EVENT<|>Cinnamon is a spice used in the spice mixture for the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is a spice used in the spice mixture for the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used to cook the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POM WONDERFUL<|>EVENT<|>POM Wonderful is a brand of pomegranate juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>EVENT<|>Cornstarch is used to thicken the pomegranate sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used to mix with cornstarch to thicken the pomegranate sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERRY VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sherry vinegar is used to add flavor to the pomegranate sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is used to add flavor to the pomegranate sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>EVENT<|>Instant-read thermometer is used to check the temperature of the pork tenderloin)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORK TENDERLOIN<|>POMEGRANATE SAUCE<|>Pork Tenderloin is served with Pomegranate Sauce<|>8"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
