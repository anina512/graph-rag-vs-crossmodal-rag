Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and boil without stirring until color is deep amber, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with pastry brush dipped into water, about 8 minutes. Working quickly, divide hot caramel among six 1 1/4-cup custard cups. Using pot holders to protect hands, tilt and rotate custard cups to cover bottoms with caramel. Set aside.\nMelt 2 tablespoons butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add apple wedges and sauté until just tender, about 12 minutes. Arrange apple wedges in bottoms of caramel-lined custard cups.\nPreheat oven to 325°F. Sift cake flour, baking powder, and salt into medium bowl. Using electric mixer, beat remaining 1/2 cup butter and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in another medium bowl until well blended. Add eggs 1 at a time and beat until well blended after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract. Beat in flour mixture in 3 additions alternately with whole milk in 2 additions. Spoon batter over apples in custard cups, dividing batter equally (about 1/2 cup for each).\nBake cakes until light golden around edges and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Run small knife around cakes to loosen. Invert cakes onto plates. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL APPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKES<|>EVENT<|>Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cakes is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a flavoring agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole milk is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla ice cream is a common dessert topping)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caramel is a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARAMEL APPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKES<|>CARAMEL<|>Caramel is a key ingredient in Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cakes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARAMEL APPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKES<|>SUGAR<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cakes<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARAMEL APPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKES<|>WATER<|>Water is a key ingredient in Caramel Apple Upside-Down Cakes<|>9"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
