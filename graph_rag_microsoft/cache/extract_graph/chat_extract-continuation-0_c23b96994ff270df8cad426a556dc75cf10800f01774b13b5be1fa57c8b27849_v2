Slice this parsley bundle thinly, as if it were a single vegetable. As you slice, the ball will come apart, but just bunch it back together as best you can, keep slicing, and you'll have a nice head start on the chopping that remains. Anchor the tip of the knife to the cutting board and use a paper cutter-like motion to chop away at your pile. Go over it a couple of times, then slide the knife under, like a spatula, and flip it over. Continue chopping and flipping until the parsley is finely chopped; transfer to a medium bowl.\nRender the garlic a paste by either pounding it in a mortar with a pinch of salt, or with a knife on a cutting board, again with salt. When the garlic is almost a thick liquid, transfer it the bowl with the parsley; add the fried herbs and the olive oil. Stir salsa verde to combine, adding more salt or oil as needed.\nHeat a grill, grill pan, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, coat the grill or pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Working in batches and adding more oil as needed, cook until well browned and crispy on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.\nPour the reduced pan juices onto a serving platter with the pork (but not over the slices or they will lose some crispness) and arrange pork slices on top. Serve with salsa verde spooned over the top, or served alongside.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BALL<|>EVENT<|>ball is a cutting tool used to chop parsley)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY BUNDLE<|>EVENT<|>parsley bundle is being chopped)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALSA VERDE<|>EVENT<|>salsa verde is a sauce made from parsley, garlic, and herbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>garlic is being pounded into a paste)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORTAR<|>EVENT<|>mortar is a tool used to pound garlic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PINCH OF SALT<|>EVENT<|>pinch of salt is added to the mortar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNIFE<|>EVENT<|>knife is used to chop parsley and garlic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUTTING BOARD<|>EVENT<|>cutting board is used to chop parsley and garlic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER CUTTER<|>EVENT<|>paper cutter-like motion is used to chop parsley)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>EVENT<|>spatula is used to flip parsley)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILL<|>EVENT<|>grill is used to cook pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILL PAN<|>EVENT<|>grill pan is used to cook pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>EVENT<|>griddle is used to cook pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>EVENT<|>cast-iron skillet is used to cook pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>vegetable oil is used to cook pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK<|>EVENT<|>pork is being cooked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVING PLATTER<|>EVENT<|>serving platter is used to serve pork)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAN JUICES<|>EVENT<|>pan juices are reduced and served with pork)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BALL<|>PARSLEY BUNDLE<|>ball is used to hold down parsley bundle while chopping<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARSLEY BUNDLE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
