Heat the milk in a small saucepan over low heat just until it's warm to the touch. Remove from the heat.\n2. Dump the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center.

Cover with a damp cloth and let stand in a warm place until double in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\n5. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Gently punch the dough down and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into four equal portions, working with one portion at a time and keeping the rest covered with a damp cloth. Divide one portion of dough into three equal pieces and roll each piece into a rope about 1 foot long and slightly tapered at the ends. Line the ropes side by side on one side of the baking sheet and braid them, pinching the ends to seal and tucking them underneath. Repeat this process with the remaining dough until you have four nicely braided loaves. Cover with a damp cloth and let stand until nearly double in size, another 25 minutes or so.\n6.
