Transfer to paper towels; let cool.\nCook ginger in a small saucepan of boiling water 1 minute. Drain ginger and rinse under cold water; set aside.\nWhisk soy sauce, tahini, miso, fish sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a small bowl until smooth.\nWhisk egg yolk and remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl to combine. Very gradually stream in 1/2 cup vegetable oil (almost drop by drop), whisking constantly until mayonnaise is emulsified and thick. Still whisking constantly, gradually add soy sauce mixture, then remaining 1/4 cup oil. Thin dressing with a tablespoon or two of water if needed; you want it to be the consistency of heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper.\nToss chicken and 1/2 cup dressing in a large bowl to coat. Add lettuce and another 1/2 cup dressing and toss again; season with salt and pepper. Crumble bacon over.\nTransfer salad to a serving bowl or platter and drizzle another tablespoon or so of dressing over salad (you may have some left over). Top with scallions, sesame seeds, and reserved ginger.\nDressing can be made 1 day ahead.
