Identify all entities.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Turn the processor on again and drizzle in the oil. Process until the hummus is smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Scrape the hummus into a bowl, cover it, and set it aside at room temperature until needed, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Bring the hummus back to room temperature before you use it.\nCombine the cucumber, onion, and haricots verts in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until needed.\nPosition an oven rack 6 inches from the broiler and heat the broiler. Brush a baking sheet with oil and slide it under the broiler to heat for 5 minutes.\nPut the cornmeal, flour, and sea salt in a shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Dip the skin side of the salmon into the breading mix and set it, skin side down, on the baking sheet. Brush the fish with oil and salt it lightly. Broil the fish for 1 1/2 minutes. Change the oven setting to 500°F and bake the fish for 7 1/2 minutes.\nRemove the baking sheet from the oven. Adjust the oven rack so it's about 3 inches from the broiler and turn the broiler back on. Spread the top of each fillet with one-quarter of the hummus. Use the back of a spoon to make peaks in the hummus (the uneven surface will give you better browning), and sprinkle each fillet with 1 teaspoon panko. Slide the baking sheet back into the oven and broil until the hummus is browned, about 2 1/2 minutes.\nTo serve, divide the salad among 4 dinner plates, spreading it out in the center of each plate. Sprinkle each salad with 1 teaspoon parsley and drizzle with 1/4 cup lemon oil. Set the salmon on top of the salad and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Step 1: Identify all entities\nTo identify all entities, we need to extract the relevant information from the text.
