We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relationships between these entities.\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library for NER and the NLTK library for tokenization and stemming:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Rum, Caramel, and Banana Bread Pudding\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['2 cups powdered sugar', '1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream, divided', '1 tablespoon dark rum', '1/4 teaspoon salt', '1 tablespoon unsalted butter', '7 cups 3/4-inch cubes crustless brioche or egg bread (from 1-pound loaf)', '6 large eggs', '3/4 cup sugar', '1/8 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon salt', '1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream', '1 1/2 cups half and half', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '1/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar', '3 tablespoons unsalted butter', '2 tablespoons dark rum', '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice', '4 medium just-ripe bananas, peeled, cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1/3-inch pieces']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nSpread powdered sugar evenly in large nonstick skillet.
