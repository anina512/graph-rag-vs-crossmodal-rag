Using a pastry cutter or knife, cut in the butter until the pieces are pea-sized. Mix in the egg, then pour in about 1/4 cup (60 mL) of milk. Mix together just until a dough forms, adding more milk if needed. Divide the dough into 10 to 12 biscuit-sized pieces. In a large frying pan, pour in about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of oil and heat over medium-high. When the oil is hot, fry the bannock—being careful not to crowd them—until golden brown. Serve immediately with maple syrup and flaky sea salt.\nIn a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and water together to form a dough. If the dough is a bit dry, add more water 1 Tbsp (15 mL) at a time. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out into a 9×12-inch (23×30-cm) rectangle about 1/4-inch (6-mm) thick. Cut into approximately 3×3-inch (8×8-cm) squares. Heat about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat, and fry the bannock—being careful not to crowd them—until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Serve warm.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>EVENT<|>Bannock Two Ways is a recipe for a traditional Canadian dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>EVENT<|>Bannock Two Ways is a recipe for a traditional Canadian dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANNOCK<|>EVENT<|>Bannock is a traditional Canadian dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANADA<|>GEO<|>Country where Bannock Two Ways is a traditional dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Maple syrup is a common topping for Bannock Two Ways)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLAKY SEA SALT<|>EVENT<|>Flaky sea salt is a common topping for Bannock Two Ways)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>BANNOCK<|>Bannock Two Ways is a recipe for a traditional Canadian dish called Bannock<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>Maple syrup is a common topping for Bannock Two Ways<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>FLAKY SEA SALT<|>Flaky sea salt is a common topping for Bannock Two Ways<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANNOCK<|>CANADA<|>Bannock is a traditional Canadian dish<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BANNOCK TWO WAYS<|>CANADA<|>Bannock Two Ways is a recipe for a traditional Canadian dish<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
