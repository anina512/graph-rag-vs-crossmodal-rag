Cut into 9 cubes.\nWhisk soy sauce, maple syrup, rice vinegar, red pepper flakes, and ginger in a small bowl.\nHeat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. When oil is rippling across the surface, carefully add tofu so it doesn’t splash. Cook, undisturbed, until very crisp and dark brown underneath, 3–4 minutes. Carefully turn and repeat on opposite side. Holding tofu back with a spatula or slotted spoon, pour out oil into a small bowl. Return skillet to medium-high heat and add soy sauce mixture. Cook, reducing heat to medium so it doesn’t over-reduce or burn and basting tofu occasionally, until glaze is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 4 minutes.\nDivide tofu among plates. Drizzle with glaze, then top with scallions. Serve with rice alongside.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CRISPY TOFU WITH MAPLE-SOY GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>Crispy Tofu With Maple-Soy Glaze is a recipe for a dish that combines crispy tofu with a sweet and savory glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOFU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tofu is a type of food made from soybeans and is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maple syrup is a sweetener made from the sap of maple trees and is used in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Soy sauce is a salty liquid condiment made from fermented soybeans and is used in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rice vinegar is a type of vinegar made from fermented rice and is used in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of root that is commonly used in cooking and is used in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIMCHI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kimchi is a type of Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables and is served with the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sesame seeds are a type of nut that is commonly used as a garnish and is used in the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIJIKI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hijiki is a type of seaweed that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine and is used in the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAIKON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Daikon is a type of root that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine and is used in the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Scallions are a type of green onion that is commonly used as a garnish and is used in the dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEAMED RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Steamed rice is a type of side dish made from cooked rice and is served with the dish)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRISPY TOFU WITH"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
