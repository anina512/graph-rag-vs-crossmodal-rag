(They will let off quite a bit of liquid; this is okay.)\nTransfer the contents of the food processor to a 4-quart stainless-steel or enameled Dutch oven. Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat, stirring continuously. Boil, still stirring, for 3 minutes, then squeeze in the pectin. Return the mixture to a rolling boil, stirring continuously, and cook for 1 minute. Immediately remove from the heat and let rest until the foam has settled, about 1 minute. Skim off and discard any remaining foam.\nSpoon the jelly into the sterilized jars and let cool for 1 hour. Seal the jars and refrigerate until chilled before using. The jelly will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 months and up to 2 years if processed in a hot water bath and kept in a cool, dry place.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_18347ef97744d22fe25d0385ff3102b67f1d3e16b3daadf49bd55232f1cb1796_v2"}
