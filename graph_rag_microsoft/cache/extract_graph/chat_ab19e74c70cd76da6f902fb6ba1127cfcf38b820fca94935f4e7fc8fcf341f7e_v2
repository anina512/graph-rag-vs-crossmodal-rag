Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify the entities (such as organizations, people, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Dependency parsing**: Analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence to identify relationships between entities.\n5. **Relationship extraction**: Identify relationships between entities based on the dependency parsing results.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform these steps:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.util import filter_spans\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = [\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"GEO\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"resides_in\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"PERSON\", \"resides_in\"),\n]\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Instant Pot Hummus\")\n\n# Extract entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append((f\"entity<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}\"))\n\n# Extract relationships\nrelationships = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    for rel in relationships:\n        if ent.label_ == rel[0] and ent.text in [r.text for r in doc.ents if r.label_ == rel[1]]:\n            source_entity = ent.text\n            target_entity = [r.text for r in doc.ents if r.label_ == rel[1] and r.text != ent.text][0]\n            relationship_description = f\"{ent.text} is {rel[2]} of {target_entity", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763443873, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2244, "total_tokens": 2756, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Leave the pot turned off and let the beans soak for 10 to 12 hours or up to overnight. You can then either drain the beans in a colander or not. If you drain them, return them to the pot and add the 3 cups water.\nIf you decide to cook the beans without soaking them, put them in the Instant Pot and add the 4 cups water and the salt.\nWhen ready to cook the chickpeas, secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Select the Bean/Chili setting and set the cooking time for 25 minutes for soaked chickpeas or 40 minutes for unsoaked chickpeas.\nLet the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the Pressure Release to Venting to release any remaining steam. At this point, you can leave the chickpeas in the pot on the Keep Warm setting for up to 10 hours.\nWhen you are ready to make the hummus, open the pot. Ladle out 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid and set it aside. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, lift the inner pot out of the Instant Pot and drain the chickpeas in a colander.\nTransfer the drained chickpeas to a food processor or blender. Add the reserved ¾ cup cooking liquid, the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and salt. Process at medium speed for about 1 minute, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.\nIf serving as an appetizer, spoon the hummus into the center of a wide, shallow serving bowl and spread it out in a thick circle. Sprinkle the parsley and paprika on top, then drizzle with the oil.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ab19e74c70cd76da6f902fb6ba1127cfcf38b820fca94935f4e7fc8fcf341f7e_v2"}
