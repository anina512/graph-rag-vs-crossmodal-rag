Heat 1 tablespoon oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots; sauté 2 minutes. Add truffles and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute. Place shallot mixture in small bowl.\nBoil wine in heavy small saucepan until reduced to 2 tablespoons, about 10 minutes. Add to shallot mixture. Whisk in vinegar and thyme. Gradually whisk in remaining 7 tablespoons oil. Season vinaigrette to taste with coarse salt. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.)\nPat steaks dry. Brush 1 tablespoon oil over both sides of steaks. Sprinkle with coarse salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over high heat. Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 2 minutes per side for rare to medium- rare (instant-read thermometer inserted into center of steaks registers 120°F to 125°F). Transfer steaks to platter; cover with foil to keep warm. Let rest 5 minutes.\nPlace steaks on plates. Spoon vinaigrette over and serve.\n*Jarred black truffles from the Périgord region in southern France are available from dartagnan.com.\n**Banyuls vinegar, made from the sweet French wine of the same name, is available at specialty foods stores and by mail from Surfas (310-559-4770; surfasonline.com).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK-PEPPER-CRUSTED WAGYU NEW YORK STEAKS<|>EVENT<|>Black-Pepper-Crusted Wagyu New York Steaks with Black Truffle Vinaigrette is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK TRUFFLE VINAIGRETTE<|>EVENT<|>Black Truffle Vinaigrette is a component of the Black-Pepper-Crusted Wagyu New York Steaks with Black Truffle Vinaigrette recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK FRENCH PÉRIGORD TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Black French Périgord truffles are a key ingredient in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TUSCAN-STYLE EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Tuscan-style extra-virgin olive oil is used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>EVENT<|>Shallots are used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CABERNET SAUVIGNON<|>EVENT<|>Cabernet Sauvignon is a wine used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BANYULS VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Banyuls vinegar is used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRESH THYME LEAVES<|>EVENT<|>Fresh thyme leaves are used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>COARSE KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Coarse kosher salt is used in the Black Truffle Vinaigrette)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>NEW YORK STRIP STEAKS<|>EVENT<|>New York strip steaks are the main ingredient in the Black-Pepper-Crusted Wagyu New York Steaks with Black Truffle Vinaigrette recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WAGYU<|>EVENT<|>Wagyu is a type of beef used in the Black-Pepper-Crusted Wagyu New York Steaks with Black Truffle Vinaigrette recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
