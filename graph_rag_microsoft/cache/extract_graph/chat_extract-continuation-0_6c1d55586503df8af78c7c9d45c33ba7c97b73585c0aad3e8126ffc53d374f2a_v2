Use your hands or a bowl scraper or wooden spatula to gently lift the dough onto the towel, so it is seam side down. If the dough is tacky, dust the top lightly with wheat bran, cornmeal, or flour. Fold the ends of the towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm, draft-free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours. The dough is ready when it is almost doubled. If you gently poke it with your finger, making an indentation about 1/4 inch deep, it should hold the impression. If it doesn't, let it rise for another 15 minutes.\n4. Half an hour before the end of the second rise, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F, with a rack in the lower third position, and place a covered 4 1/2–5 1/2 quart heavy pot in the center of the rack.\n5. Using pot holders, carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven and uncover it. Unfold the tea towel, lightly dust the dough with flour or bran, lift up the dough, either on the towel or in your hand, and quickly but gently invert it into the pot, seam side up. (Use caution—the pot will be very hot.) Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes.\n6. Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color but not burnt, 15 to 30 minutes more. Use a heatproof spatula or pot holders to carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool thoroughly. Don't slice or tear into it until it has cooled, which usually takes at least an hour.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHEAT BRAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wheat bran is a type of flour used in bread making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNMEAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornmeal is a type of flour used in bread making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of powder used in bread making)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A towel is used to cover the dough during the rising process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A spatula is used to lift the dough onto the towel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bowl is used to mix the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANDS<|>PERSON<|>Hands are used to mix the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM SPOT<|>GEO<|>A warm spot is used to let the dough rise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An oven is used to bake the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pot is used to bake the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rack is used to cool the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A heavy pot is used to bake the bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A tea towel is used to cover the dough during the rising process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POT HOLDERS<|>PERSON<|>Pot holders are used to handle the hot pot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEATPROOF SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A heatproof spatula is used to lift the bread out of the pot)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHEAT BRAN<|>CORNMEAL<|>Wheat bran and cornmeal are both types of flour used in bread making<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHEAT BRAN<|>FLOUR<|>Wheat bran and flour are both types of powder used in bread making"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
