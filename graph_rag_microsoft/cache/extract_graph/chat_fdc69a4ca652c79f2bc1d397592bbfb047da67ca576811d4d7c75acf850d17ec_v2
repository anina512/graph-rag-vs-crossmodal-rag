Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n\n2. **Entity Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to extract relationships.\n\n4. **Relationship Scoring**: Assign a score to each relationship based on its strength. We'll use a combination of factors such as entity type, relationship type, and context to determine the relationship strength.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nimport re\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = [\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"GEO\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"GEO\", \"neighbor\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"PERSON\", \"friend\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"partner\"),\n]\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Beef Bone Broth\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['4 pounds beef bones, preferably a mix of marrow bones and bones with a little meat on them, such as oxtail, short ribs, or knuckle bones (cut in half by a butcher)', '2 medium unpeeled carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces', '1 medium leek, end trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces', '1 medium onion, quartered', '1 garlic head, halved crosswise', '2 celery stalks, cut into 2-inch pieces', '2 bay leaves', '2 tablespoons black peppercorns', '1 tablespoon cider vinegar', '6-quart (or larger) stockpot or a large slow cooker']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nPreheat oven to 450°F.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763442546, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2208, "total_tokens": 2720, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

Place beef bones, carrots, leek, onion, and garlic on a roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes. Toss the contents of the pan and continue to roast until deeply browned, about 20 minutes more.\nFill a large (at least 6-quart) stockpot with 12 cups of water (preferably filtered) . Add celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, and vinegar. Scrape the roasted bones and vegetables into the pot along with any juices. Add more water if necessary to cover bones and vegetables.\nCover the pot and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to a very low simmer and cook with lid slightly ajar, skimming foam and excess fat occasionally, for at least 8 but up to 24 hours on the stovetop. (Do not leave on stovetop unattended, simply cool and continue simmering the next day.) The longer you simmer it, the better your broth will be. Add more water if necessary to ensure bones and vegetables are fully submerged. Alternately, you can cook the broth in a slow cooker on low for the same amount of time.\nRemove the pot from the heat and let cool slightly. Strain broth using a fine-mesh sieve and discard bones and vegetables. Let continue to cool until barely warm, then refrigerate in smaller containers overnight. Remove solidified fat from the top of the chilled broth.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_fdc69a4ca652c79f2bc1d397592bbfb047da67ca576811d4d7c75acf850d17ec_v2"}
