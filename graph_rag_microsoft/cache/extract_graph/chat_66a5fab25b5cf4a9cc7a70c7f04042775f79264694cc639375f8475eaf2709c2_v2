Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify the entities in the text. We'll consider the following entity types: organization, person, geo, and event.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the NER model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Classic Chocolate Soufflé\\nIngredients:\\n['6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces', '3 egg yolks', '1/2 cup granulated sugar', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract', '5 egg whites', \\\"Sifted confectioners' sugar\\\", 'Whipped cream or drambuie-flavored crème anglaise']\\nInstructions:\\n1. Position the rack in the lowest part of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Brush six 3/4-cup ovenproof soufflé dishes with melted butter and invert the dishes to allow excess butter to drip out. Then, pour a little granulated sugar into each dish, turning to coat all sides, tapping out any excess sugar (see page 112). For easier handling, arrange the dishes on a flat baking tray and set aside.\\n2. In a small heatproof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water, melt the chocolate. When almost melted, turn off the heat and let the chocolate melt completely, stirring occasionally.\\n3. Meanwhile, in the large bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle or beaters, on high speed beat together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and the vanilla until pale yellow and thick. Scrape the melted chocolate into the yolks and continue to beat until well combined.\\n4. In another clean large bowl, with whip or clean beaters, whip the 5 egg whites. Start on medium speed and raise the speed as peaks begin to form. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and continue to whip until the whites are shiny and firm, but not stiff. (When the bowl is tipped slightly, the whites should stay in place.) Stir one-third of the whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten, then turn the chocolate back into the whites and fold until completely incorporated.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
