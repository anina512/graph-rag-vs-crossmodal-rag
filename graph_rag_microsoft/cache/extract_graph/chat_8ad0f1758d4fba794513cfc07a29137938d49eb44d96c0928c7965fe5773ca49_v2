Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(text):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in [\"ORG\", \"PERSON\", \"GPE\", \"EVENT\"]:\n            entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_, ent.text))\n    return entities\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Salmon Cannelloni with Lemon Cream Sauce\"\nentities = custom_entity_recognition(text)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"({entity[0]}<|>{entity[0].capitalize()}<|>{entity[1]}<|>{entity[2]})\")\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform relationship extraction on the text.

Transfer to a bowl and stir in tarragon.\nLightly brush a 10-inch nonstick skillet with melted butter and heat over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into skillet, tilting and rotating skillet to coat bottom, then pour excess batter back into bowl. (If batter sets before skillet is coated, reduce heat slightly for next crespella.) Cook until just set and underside is lightly browned, about 30 seconds, then invert crespella onto a clean kitchen towel in one layer to cool. (It will be cooked on one side only.) Make 5 more crespelle with remaining batter in same manner, brushing skillet with butter as needed and transferring to towel as cooked, arranging them in one layer.\nHeat butter in a 1- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat until foam subsides. Add flour and cook, whisking, 2 minutes. Add clam juice and water in a slow stream, whisking, then bring to a boil, whisking. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in cream, zest, and pepper, then remove from heat.\nPut oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 425°F.
