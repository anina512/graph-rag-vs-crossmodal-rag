Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coriander, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne and cook until mixture starts to stick to bottom of skillet, about 1 minute. Add potatoes and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and toss to coat. Add 1/2 cup water and scrape up any bits in bottom of skillet. Stir in tomatoes and their juices and salt. Bring to a simmer, breaking up tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Cover and cook, adding more water by the tablespoonful if necessary, until potatoes are tender, 20–25 minutes.\nStir to combine (it’s okay, and kind of preferred, if some of the potatoes get a little smashed here). Add eggs, turn to coat in sauce, and simmer until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Divide curry among bowls and top with cilantro and yogurt. Serve with rice or naan.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>EGG CURRY<|>EVENT<|>Egg Curry is a popular Indian dish made with eggs, potatoes, and spices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATOES<|>EVENT<|>Tomatoes are a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>EVENT<|>Cilantro is used as a garnish in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are a main ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Vegetable oil is used for cooking in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORIANDER SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Coriander seeds are ground into a powder and used in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Cumin seeds are ground into a powder and used in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>EVENT<|>Onion is a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>EVENT<|>Ginger is a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURMERIC<|>EVENT<|>Turmeric is a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAYENNE PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Cayenne pepper is a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POTATOES<|>EVENT<|>Potatoes are a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHERRY TOMATOES<|>EVENT<|>Cherry tomatoes are a key ingredient in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used to season Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAIN YOGURT<|>EVENT<|>Plain yogurt is used as a garnish in Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEAMED BASMATI RICE<|>EVENT<|>Steamed basmati rice is served with Egg Curry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAAN<|>EVENT<|>Naan"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
