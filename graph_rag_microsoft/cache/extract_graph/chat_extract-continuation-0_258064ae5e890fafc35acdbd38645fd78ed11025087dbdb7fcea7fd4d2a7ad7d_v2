Prepare a hot fire in a grill.\n2. To make the vinaigrette, whisk all the ingredients in a small bowl until well blended. Set aside. (Vinaigrette can be made up to 4 days ahead of time and stored, covered, in the refrigerator.)\n3. Arrange the oysters in their half shells on a large baking sheet. Spoon about 1 teaspoon vinaigrette over each oyster and bring out to the grill. Add the wood chips to the coals or place the smoker box or packet close to a gas jet on a gas grill. When you see the first wisp of smoke, quickly arrange the oysters on the grill grate. Close the lid and grill for 3 to 5 minutes or until the edges of the oysters have begun to curl.\n4. Arrange the oysters on plates or a platter and serve, passing extra vinaigrette at the table.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHIPOTLE VINAIGRETTE<|>EVENT<|>Chipotle Vinaigrette is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOOD-GRILLED OYSTERS<|>EVENT<|>Wood-Grilled Oysters in Chipotle Vinaigrette is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIPOTLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chipotle is a type of pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHERRY VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sherry vinegar is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Balsamic vinegar is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIPOTLE CHILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chipotle chiles are an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADOBOSAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Adobo sauce is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HICKORY OR MESQUITE CHIPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hickory or mesquite chips are used for grilling the oysters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARCOAL GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charcoal grill is a type of grill used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKER BOX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smoker box is a device used for smoking the oysters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL PACKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aluminum foil packet is a device used for smoking the oysters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAS GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gas grill is a type of grill used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OYSTERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oysters"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
