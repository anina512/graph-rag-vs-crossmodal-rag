Lift the lid and check to see if the slices are etched with grill marks and tender.\nIf not, continue to cook as needed. Transfer the slices to a flat plate and season with additional salt and pepper.\nTo cook the squash slices in the oven, coat a half sheet pan with a generous film of olive oil. Arrange the zucchini and yellow squash slices in a single layer, turning to coat both sides with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Set the pan on the top stone and cook for 4 to 5 minutes.\nThe slices will cook and sizzle in the oil but should not brown (this would toughen the edges). Transfer the slices to a flat plate and season with additional salt and pepper.\nDust the work surface with the dusting mixture, then move the dough to the surface and dust the top.\nSprinkle a wooden peel with the dusting mixture. Open the dough on the work surface to a 13-inch round with a slightly raised edge. Move the dough to the peel. As you work, shake the peel forward and backward to ensure the dough isn't sticking.\nMound the mozzarella in the center of the dough and use your fingertips to spread it evenly over the surface, leaving a 3/4-inch border.\nSlide the dough onto the top stone. Bake for 7 minutes.\nRemove the pizza from the oven and place on a cutting board (or work directly on the peel if there is room to set it on the work surface). Place the zucchini slices on the pizza, arranging them like the spokes of a wheel.\nThen put the yellow squash slices between the zucchini slices, placing 2 slices in each section.\nLift the pizza with the peel (if on a cutting board) rotate it 180 degrees and then transfer. Bake for 6 minutes, until the bottom is browned and crisp and the top is golden brown.\nTransfer the pizza to a cutting board and cut into 6 wedges. Crumble the Feta over the pizza, then scatter the olives and Peppadew peppers evenly over the top. Finish with a dusting of pecorino and oregano and with a drizzle of garlic oil over the surface and the crust.\nJust before serving, squeeze the lemon over the top.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_7c067110da1f50a148f3ec0dafdcfb42fb3f2cc62156f10100792e17b5951a9c_v2"}
