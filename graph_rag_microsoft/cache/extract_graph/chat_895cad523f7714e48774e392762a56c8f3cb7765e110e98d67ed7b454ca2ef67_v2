Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem statement.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in [\"ORG\", \"PERSON\", \"GPE\", \"LOC\"]:\n            ents.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Parsnip and Butternut Squash with Flatbreads\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['10 1/2 oz. butternut squash, peeled and cut into rough 3/4-inch cubes', '18 oz. parsnips, cut into rough 3/4-inch cubes', '3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling', '1 tsp. fennel seeds, ground', '1 tsp. cumin seeds, ground', '1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '3 1/2 oz. sprouted lentils (store-bought or sprouted at home)', '3 1/2 oz. arugula', '2 oz. full-fat Greek yogurt, to serve (optional)', '5 1/2 oz. spelt flour, plus extra for dusting', '1/3 cup tepid water', '1 Tbsp. olive oil', 'Generous pinch of salt and pepper', '1/4 tsp. ground coriander']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nPreheat the oven to 400°F.\\nPut the cubed butternut squash and parsnips in a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, and scatter the spices on top, tossing to thoroughly coat the vegetables in the spiced oil.

This will gently wilt the leaves.
