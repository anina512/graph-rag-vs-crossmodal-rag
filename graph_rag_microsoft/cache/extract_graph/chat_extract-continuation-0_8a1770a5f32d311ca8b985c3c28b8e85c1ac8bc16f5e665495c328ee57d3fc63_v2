Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n\n2. **Entity Extraction**: Extract the relevant information from the identified entities, including entity name, type, and description.\n\n3. **Relationship Identification**: Identify relationships between entities using a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches. We'll use the spaCy library to extract dependencies and the Stanford CoreNLP library to extract semantic roles.\n\n4. **Relationship Scoring**: Assign a score to each relationship based on its strength.
