Slice the top quarter off each pumpkin and remove the seeds and stringy bits.\n» In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, sauté the sausage for 3 to 4 minutes, until cooked through. Drain off any rendered fat and set aside.\n» Whisk 1 of the eggs, and toss it in a large bowl with the sausage, bread cubes, sage, parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.\n» Fill each pumpkin with the stuffing mixture to a little less than 1 inch from the top, and place it on the prepared sheet. Bake for 40 minutes, until the pumpkins have soft- ened. Remove the pan from the oven and use a spoon to compress the stuffing a little. Pour 1 of the remaining 4 eggs into each pumpkin. Lightly cover the pumpkins with a sheet of aluminum foil. Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and return the sheet to the oven. Bake for another 10 minutes, until the eggs are just set.\n» Serve hot, topped with about a teaspoon of crème fraîche and more salt and pepper to taste.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>EVENT<|>Baked Mini Pumpkin Pots is a recipe for a dish made with mini pumpkins, sausage, eggs, and bread)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MINI PUMPKINS<|>GEO<|>Mini pumpkins are a type of pumpkin used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SWEET OR HOT BULK SAUSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sweet or hot bulk sausage is a type of sausage used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>STALE BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stale bread is a type of bread used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRESH SAGE<|>PERSON<|>Fresh sage is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN PARSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Italian parsley is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crème fraîche is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>MINI PUMPKINS<|>Mini pumpkins are the main ingredient in the recipe<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>SWEET OR HOT BULK SAUSAGE<|>Sausage is a key ingredient in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>EGGS<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>STALE BREAD<|>Stale bread is a type of bread used in the recipe<|>7)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED MINI PUMPKIN POTS<|>FRESH SAGE<|>Fresh sage is a type of herb used in the recipe<|>6)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
