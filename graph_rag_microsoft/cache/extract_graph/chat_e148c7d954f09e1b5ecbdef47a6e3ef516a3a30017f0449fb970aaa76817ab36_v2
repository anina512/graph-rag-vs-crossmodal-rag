Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify the entities (organization, person, geo, event) in the text.\n4. **Relationship extraction**: Identify the relationships between entities.\n5. **Entity and relationship formatting**: Format the entities and relationships as required.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet using the spaCy library to perform these tasks:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = [\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"GEO\", \"located_in\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"resides_in\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"EVENT\", \"hosted\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"EVENT\", \"attended\"),\n]\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Olive Oil Apple Cake with Spiced Sugar\")\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}')\")\n\n# Identify relationships\nrelationships_list = []\nfor ent1 in doc.ents:\n    for ent2 in doc.ents:\n        if ent1 != ent2:\n            for rel in relationships:\n                if ent1.label_ == rel[0] and ent2.label_ == rel[1]:\n                    relationship_description = f\"{ent1.text} {rel[2]} {ent2.text}\"\n                    relationship_strength = 1\n                    relationships_list.append(\n                        f\"('relationship'<|>{ent1.text}<|>{ent2.text}<|>{relationship_description}<|>{relationship_strength}')\"\n                    )\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"**##\".join(entities + relationships_list)\nprint(output)\nprint(\"<", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763455727, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2261, "total_tokens": 2773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

(100 g plus 10 g) granulated sugar, plus more for pan', '2 sweet apples, such as Golden Delicious or Gala', '1 tsp. ground cinnamon', '1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1/2 tsp. ground cardamom', '1/2 tsp. ground ginger', '1 1/2 cups (185 g) all-purpose flour', '2 tsp. baking powder', '2 large eggs', '2 egg yolks', '1/2 cup (100 g) (packed) brown sugar', '1 tsp. vanilla extract', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt']\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Pour about 1 Tbsp. oil into a 9x5\" loaf pan and coat bottom and sides with fingertips. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto sides and bottom of pan to lightly coat.\nGrate apples, peel and all, on the large holes of a box grater. Gather apples in a clean kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid. Be aggressive! You want them as dry as possible when they go into the batter.\nWhisk cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and ginger in a medium bowl. Transfer 1/4 tsp. spice mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Add flour and baking powder to remaining spice mixture and whisk to combine.\nWhisk together eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking vigorously until lightened in color and thickened. Whisking with one hand and pouring with the other, slowly stream 1 cup oil into egg mixture until combined. Gently fold flour mixture into whipped eggs with a flexible rubber spatula just until combined, taking care not to overmix.\nFluff up grated apples and scatter over batter. Gently fold to incorporate.\nTransfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Add 2 tsp. granulated sugar to reserved spice mixture and mix to combine. Sprinkle spiced sugar evenly over top of batter.\nBake cake until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–70 minutes. Let cake cool in pan.
