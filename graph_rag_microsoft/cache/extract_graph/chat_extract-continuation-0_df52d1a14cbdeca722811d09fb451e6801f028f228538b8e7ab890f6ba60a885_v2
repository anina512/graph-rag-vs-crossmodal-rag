Leave to the side to cool.\nMeanwhile, in another saucepan, cover the beet with water; bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the beet is tender. Drain, and when cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and cut the beet into coarse chunks.\nChop the pomegranate in half and extract the seeds. Add the pomegranate, beet, olive oil, and mint to the rice. Leave to the side.\nMake the wasabi coating by mixing together the mayonnaise, cumin, and wasabi. Taste and adjust if you want. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.\nWash and dry the salmon, and season. Heat a griddle or ovenproof frying pan big enough to fit both salmon fillets and, when it is searing hot, drop in the salmon, skin-side down. Turn after 5 minutes or when the skin is brown and crispy. Take off the heat, carefully turn again, and spoon the wasabi coating onto the top of the salmon. Put the pan into the oven and cook for around 10 minutes, until the coating begins to brown. Serve on the wild rice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WILD RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wild rice is a type of grain used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beet is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POMEGRANATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pomegranate is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of cooking oil used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH MINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fresh mint is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mayonnaise is a type of condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cumin is a type of spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WASABI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wasabi is a type of condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmon fillets are the main ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILD RICE<|>GEO<|>Wild rice is a type of grain that is native to North America)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEET<|>GEO<|>Beet is a type of vegetable that is native to Europe and Asia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POMEGRANATE<|>GEO<|>Pomegranate is a type of fruit that is native to the Middle East and South Asia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>GEO<|>Olive oil is a type of cooking oil that is native to the Mediterranean region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH MINT<|>GEO<|>Fresh mint is a type of herb that is native to the Middle East and Asia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>GEO<|>Mayonnaise is a type of condiment that originated in France)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN<|>GEO<|>Cumin is a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
