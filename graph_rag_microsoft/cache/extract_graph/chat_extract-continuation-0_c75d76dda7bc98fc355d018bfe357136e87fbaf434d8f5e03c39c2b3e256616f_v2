Arrange 12 of the bacon slices, overlapping slightly, on the paper. Place half the stuffing along one edge of the bacon and shape into a log. Using the foil and paper to help you, roll the bacon to enclose the stuffing, wrapping to secure. Repeat with the remaining foil, baking paper, bacon and stuffing. Place the rolls on a baking tray and roast for 20 minutes.\nPlace the extra sherry and honey in a small bowl and mix to combine. Remove the rolls from the foil and paper and return to the tray.
