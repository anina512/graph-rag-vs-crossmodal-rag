In either case, wrap the whole apparatus tightly in plastic wrap and allow the fish to cure in the refrigerator for 1 day.\nAfter a day, unwrap the fish and flip it over, being sure all the flesh comes into contact with the curing mix (which should be mostly liquid at this point). Weight the fish down again and wrap it again in fresh plastic. Cure in the fridge for 3 or 4 more days, depending on the thickness of your fillet.
