For these last few minutes, watch them closely, stirring gently. When the fries are a deep golden brown, taste one to make sure they are truly crisp and firm on the outside with a creamy interior. They should not be the least bit soggy, so resist the urge to remove them from the oil too soon. When you are happy with the consistency, carefully transfer the rest of the fries with the wire skimmer or slotted spoon to the paper-towel-lined trays to drain. Season with salt and serve immediately on the warmed platter.\nUse firm, fresh potatoes. Rinse and soak them well to rid them of starch. The less starch in the potatoes, the crispier the fries will be.\nTo keep the oil well contained in the pot, make sure there is at least 2 inches (5 cm) of room from the top of the oil to the rim of the pot.\nWe have made these fries in varied quantities with proportionate quantities of oil and pot size: 1 pound (500 g) potatoes/1 1/2 quarts (1.5 l) oil/4-quart (4 l) pot 2 pounds (1 kg) potatoes/2 1/2 quarts (2.5 l) oil/5- to 7-quart (5 to 7 l) pot 3 pounds (1.5 kg) potatoes/3 quarts (3 l) oil/7-quart (7 l) pot 4 pounds (2 kg) potatoes/4 quarts (4 l) oil/8- to 9-quart (8 to 9 l) pot\nDo not use an aluminum pot; it will not hold the heat in the same manner as a heavy cast-iron or stainless steel pot, and the results may not be satisfactory.\nAfter frying, let the oil cool and strain it through cheesecloth into the original containers. Store in the refrigerator and reuse up to five times. Mark the bottles as to number of uses and sniff the oil before reusing; if there is any scent of rancidity, toss. Each time the oil is reused, add about 1 cup (250 ml) fresh, new oil to the mix.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Potatoes are a type of vegetable used to make fries)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TIMER<|>EVENT<|>Timer is used to determine when the potatoes are cooked)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WIRE SKIMMER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire skimmer is a tool used to remove the fries from the oil)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PAPER-TOWEL-LINED TRAYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paper-towel-lined trays are used to drain the excess oil from the fries)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used to add flavor to the fries)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WARMED PLATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warmed platter is a serving dish used to serve the fries)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fries are a type of food made from potatoes)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil is a cooking medium used to fry the potatoes)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pot is a cooking vessel used to hold the oil)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron pot is a type of pot used for frying)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>STAINLESS STEEL POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stainless steel pot is a type of pot used for frying)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aluminum pot is a type of pot that should not be used for frying)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHEESECLOTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheesecloth is a material used to strain the oil)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>REFRIGERATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Refrigerator is a storage unit used to store the oil)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CONTAINERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Containers are used to store the oil)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRESH POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fresh potatoes are a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
