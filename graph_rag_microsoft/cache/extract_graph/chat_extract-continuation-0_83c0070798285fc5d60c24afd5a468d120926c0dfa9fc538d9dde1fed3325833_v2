Allow to cool. Using a large serrated knife, trim crust off all sides of cake to make an even rectangle. Slice the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each piece in half lengthwise. Cut each long section crosswise three times to make 16 small squares. Repeat with second loaf.\nUsing a small serrated knife, cut a square from the center of each cube, leaving a 1/2-inch wall around the edges. Remove the cut sections carefully, making sure to leave enough cake on the bottom to hold the filling.\nPlace the squares on an unlined baking sheet. Brush the upper edges of the cake squares with the melted butter using a pastry brush. Place under broiler for a few minutes until lightly toasted, making sure to watch closely — the squares brown quickly. Remove from oven and let cool.\nThese can be made up to 2 days ahead. If storing, pound cake squares can be transferred to airtight containers or placed closely together on a baking sheet and covered with plastic wrap, and stored in the refrigerator.\nPlace the whipping cream in the bowl of an electric mixer and whip until soft peaks form. Add the sugar slowly and whip until slightly stiff. Place a spoonful of whipped cream on each square, topped with sliced and whole berries, and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>POUND CAKE SQUARES WITH BERRIES<|>EVENT<|>Pound Cake Squares with Berries is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUND CAKE MIX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pound Cake Mix is a product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHIPPING CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whipping Cream is a product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXED BERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mixed Berries is a product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRAWBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Strawberries are a type of berry used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Raspberries are a type of berry used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUEBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blueberries are a type of berry used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUND CAKE SQUARES WITH BERRIES<|>POUND CAKE MIX<|>Pound Cake Squares with Berries uses Pound Cake Mix<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUND CAKE SQUARES WITH BERRIES<|>BUTTER<|>Pound Cake Squares with Berries uses Butter<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUND CAKE SQUARES WITH BERRIES<|>WHIPPING CREAM<|>Pound Cake Squares with Berries uses Whipping Cream<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POUND CAKE SQUARES WITH BERRIES<|>SUGAR<|>Pound Cake"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
