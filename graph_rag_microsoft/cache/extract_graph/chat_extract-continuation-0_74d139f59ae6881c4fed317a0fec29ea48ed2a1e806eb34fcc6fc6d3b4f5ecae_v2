In a Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat and sauté the rabbit pieces until well browned, about 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and reserve.\n2. Using the same pan you browned the rabbit in, and without wiping it out, sauté the bacon over medium heat until it's browned and has rendered its fat in the pan, about 10 minutes. Add the flour and cook, whisking constantly, until it is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add the curry paste and stir to combine well with the flour mixture. Stir in the chicken broth, 1/4 cup at a time. The pan contents now will have the consistency of a thin sauce.\n3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the browned rabbit pieces along with the onions, mushrooms, celery, and salt. Simmer the dish, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through, the onions are tender, and the sauce has thickened up, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve warm, preferably over rice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH RABBIT CURRY<|>EVENT<|>Scottish Rabbit Curry is a recipe that combines rabbit with British or Canadian bacon and various spices to create a dish that can be served over rice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RABBIT<|>PERSON<|>Rabbit is the main ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH OR CANADIAN BACON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bacon is a type of cured meat used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of powder used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRY PASTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Curry paste is a type of spice blend used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken broth is a type of liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEARL ONIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pearl onions are a type of onion used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTON MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Button mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Celery is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASMATIC RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Basmatic rice is a type of rice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH RABBIT CURRY<|>BUTTER<|>Butter is used in the recipe for Scottish Rabbit Curry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH RABBIT CURRY<|>RABBIT<|>Rabbit is the main ingredient in the recipe for Scottish Rabbit Curry<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH RABBIT CURRY<|>BRITISH OR CANADIAN BACON<|>Bacon is used"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
