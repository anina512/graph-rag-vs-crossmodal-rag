In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter until smooth and creamy.\n2. Add the sugar, egg, and vanilla extract and mix well.\n3. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt and beat until completely mixed.\n4. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n5. Preheat the oven to 325°F.\n6. With your hands, roll a heaping tablespoon of dough into a finger shape for each cookie. If the dough gets sticky and hard to work with, put it back in the refrigerator for a little while. Place fingers on an ungreased cookie sheet about 3 inches apart.\n7. Use a butter knife to make knuckle marks on the finger cookies. Slightly flatten the front of the finger to create a nail.\n8. Bake 20-25 minutes, until fingers are slightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool. Meanwhile, prepare the Icing Glue. Mix together powdered sugar and water in a small bowl until the consistency is similar to that of a paste.\n9. Attach almond slice fingernails to the tips of the fingers with Icing Glue. Let glue dry for about 30 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FINGER COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Finger Cookies is a type of cookie that is made with a specific set of ingredients and instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>EVENT<|>Ingredients are the components used to make Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWDERED SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Powdered sugar is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>EVENT<|>Egg is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla extract is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>All-purpose flour is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>EVENT<|>Baking powder is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLICED ALMONDS<|>EVENT<|>Sliced almonds are an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICING GLUE<|>EVENT<|>Icing Glue is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE SHEET<|>EVENT<|>Cookie sheet is a tool used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is a tool used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER KNIFE<|>EVENT<|>Butter knife is a tool used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMOND SLICE<|>EVENT<|>Almond slice is a tool used in the making of Finger Cookies)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>FINGER COOKIES<|>Butter is an ingredient used in the making of Finger Cookies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWDER"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
