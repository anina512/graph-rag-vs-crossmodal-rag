Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring cup and chill until ready to use.\nUsing a serrated knife, trim top of each cake to make them flat. Brush tops with 2–3 Tbsp. syrup per cake, depending on how concentrated you'd like the thyme flavor to be.\nToss 10 oz. strawberries with1 Tbsp. syrup in a medium bowl and let sit at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, whip heavy cream to soft peaks in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Add sour cream and 2 Tbsp. syrup and whip to stiff peaks.\nTransfer 1 cake layer to a platter and top with syrup-macerated strawberries. Top with half of the whipped cream, then place second cake layer gently on the first. Top with remaining whipped cream. Chill to set, at least 1 hour. Just before serving, arrange remaining 6 oz. strawberries, baby strawberries, if using, and thyme over cake.\nCakes can be baked and syrup-soaked, but not assembled, 2 days ahead; wrap layers separately in plastic and chill. Thyme syrup can be made 5 days ahead; chill in a resealable container. Assembled cake can be made 12 hours ahead; chill.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FORM<|>EVENT<|>Form is a step in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSFER<|>EVENT<|>Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool completely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKES<|>EVENT<|>Cakes are the main dish being prepared)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>EVENT<|>A saucepan is used to boil sugar, thyme, and water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH SIEVE<|>EVENT<|>A fine-mesh sieve is used to strain the syrup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEASURING CUP<|>EVENT<|>A measuring cup is used to chill the syrup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERATED KNIFE<|>EVENT<|>A serrated knife is used to trim the top of each cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Syrup is used to brush the tops of the cakes and to macerate the strawberries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRAWBERRIES<|>EVENT<|>Strawberries are used as a topping for the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is whipped to make whipped cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>EVENT<|>A stand mixer is used to whip the heavy cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHIP<|>EVENT<|>Whipping is a step in making the whipped cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATTER<|>EVENT<|>A platter is used to assemble the cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILL<|>EVENT<|>Chilling is a step in setting the whipped cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERVE<|>EVENT<|>Serving is the final step in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FORM<|>TRANSFER<|>Form is a step that precedes transfer in the recipe<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSFER<|>CAKES<|>Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool completely<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKES<|>SAUCEPAN<|>Cakes are the main dish being prepared and a saucepan is used to boil sugar, thyme,"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
