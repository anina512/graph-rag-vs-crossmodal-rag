Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place pumpkin, cut side down, on parchment. Bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Cool.\nScoop pumpkin flesh into processor; discard skin. Combine cinnamon, ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg in small bowl. Add half of cinnamon mixture to pumpkin in processor. Add brown sugar, eggs, milk, cream, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt. Process until very smooth. DO AHEAD: Filling can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to large bowl, cover, and chill.\nIncrease oven temperature to 425°F. Lightly butter 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. Place rimmed baking sheet in oven to heat. Stir 2 tablespoons sugar into remaining cinnamon mixture.\nLay 1 phyllo sheet on clean work surface and brush lightly with butter (keep remaining phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap and damp towel to prevent drying). Sprinkle 1 scant teaspoonful cinnamon mixture over phyllo. Repeat 4 times with phyllo, butter, and cinnamon mixture. Arrange stacked phyllo in tart pan, gently pressing and allowing long sides to hang over edge of pan. Repeat layering process with 5 remaining phyllo sheets. Arrange stacked phyllo crosswise atop first sheets so that overhanging corners point in opposite directions. Roll overhang in to form edge of crust. Pour pumpkin into pan.\nPlace pie on hot baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and bake until tester inserted into center of filling comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
