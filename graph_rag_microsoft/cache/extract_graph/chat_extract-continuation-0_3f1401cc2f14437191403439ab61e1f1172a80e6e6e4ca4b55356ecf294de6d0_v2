Transfer to cutting board along with garlic, fennel fronds, salt, and pepper and finely chop together. Transfer mixture to a small bowl and stir in oil.\nLay pork belly on cutting board, skin side down. Holding a large sharp knife parallel to the cutting board, split the belly in half, being careful not to cut all the way through the opposite end. Open the split belly like a book and spread fennel-garlic mixture all over. Place pork loin at the end of the skinless side of the belly, and tightly roll the belly around the loin, forming a roast. The skin should almost wrap the roast completely. Using butchers' string, tightly tie the roast at 1-inch intervals.\nTransfer the porchetta to a large roasting pan and roast for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the pan from the oven and add the potatoes and rosemary. Season with salt and toss the potatoes in the pan juices to coat. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of roast registers 165°F and potatoes are tender, about 2 hours more.\nLet the porcetta rest for 20 minutes before slicing.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PORCHETTA<|>EVENT<|>Porchetta is a traditional Italian dish made with pork belly and loin, served with roasted potatoes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTED POTATOES<|>EVENT<|>Roasted potatoes are a side dish often served with porchetta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL SEEDS<|>INGREDIENT<|>Fennel seeds are used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>INGREDIENT<|>Garlic is used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL FRONDS<|>INGREDIENT<|>Fennel fronds are used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>INGREDIENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>INGREDIENT<|>Black pepper is used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>INGREDIENT<|>Extra-virgin olive oil is used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK BELLY<|>INGREDIENT<|>Pork belly is a key ingredient in the preparation of porchetta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK LOIN<|>INGREDIENT<|>Pork loin is a key ingredient in the preparation of porchetta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>INGREDIENT<|>Fingerling potatoes are a side dish often served with porchetta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSEMARY<|>INGREDIENT<|>Rosemary is used in the preparation of porchetta to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTCHER'S TWINE<|>INGREDIENT<|>Butcher's twine is used to tie the porchetta roast)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE ROASTING PAN<|>INGREDIENT<|>Large roasting pan is used to roast the porchetta)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PORCHETTA<|>ROASTED POTATOES<|>Porchetta is often served with roasted potatoes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
