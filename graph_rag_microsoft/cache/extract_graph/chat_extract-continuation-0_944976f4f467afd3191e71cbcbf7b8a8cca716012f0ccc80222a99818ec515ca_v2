Knead on a lightly floured surface until just smooth, 1 to 2 minutes, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature at least 10 minutes.\nWhile dough stands, halve ginger, then finely chop 1 half and cut remaining half into very thin matchsticks (less than 1/8 inch thick).\nCombine 5 tablespoons soy sauce with ginger matchsticks in a small bowl.\nReserve 2 tablespoons scallions for garnish, then finely chop remainder and put in a bowl along with pork, finely chopped ginger, and remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce. Gently knead with your hands in bowl until just combined. Chill, covered, 10 minutes.\nWhile pork mixture chills, line a large baking sheet with paper towels and dust lightly with flour, then lightly dust a work surface with flour. Halve dough and rewrap 1 half. Pat remaining half into a flat square. Roll out dough into a 13-inch square (less than 1/8 inch thick) with a lightly floured rolling pin, dusting work surface with additional flour as needed, then cut out 12 rounds (very close together) using cookie cutter. (If dough is sticking to cutter, lightly dip cutter in flour and shake off excess before cutting out each round.) Reserve scraps.\nTransfer rounds to lined baking sheet and cover loosely with another layer of paper towels lightly dusted (on top) with flour. Roll out remaining half of dough and cut out 12 more rounds in same manner, then transfer rounds to lined baking sheet. Combine scraps of dough and wrap in plastic wrap, then let stand at least 10 minutes.\nWhile scraps are standing, begin forming dumplings. Line another large baking sheet with paper towels and dust lightly with flour. Put 1 dough round on fingers of 1 hand near palm and put 2 slightly rounded teaspoons pork mixture in center of round. Fold round in half, enclosing filling\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PORK DUMPLINGS<|>EVENT<|>Pork Dumplings is a recipe for a traditional Chinese dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>PERSON<|>Scallions are a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND PORK<|>PERSON<|>Ground pork is a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Soy sauce is a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>PERSON<|>All-purpose flour is a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHT SOY SAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Light soy sauce is a key ingredient in Pork Dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKING COOKIE CUTTER<|>PERSON<|>A 3 1/4-inch round cookie cutter is used to cut out dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>PERSON<|>Paper towels are used to line baking sheets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>PERSON<|>Plastic wrap is used to wrap dough and scraps)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>PERSON<|>A baking sheet is used to cook dumplings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORK SURFACE<|>PERSON<|>A work surface is used to roll out dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLLING PIN<|>PERSON<|>A rolling pin is used to roll out dough)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GINGER<|>SCALLIONS<|>Ginger and scallions are used together in Pork Dumplings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROUND PORK<|>SOY SAUCE<|>Ground pork and soy sauce are used together in Pork Dumplings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>LIGHT SOY SAUCE<|>All-purpose flour and light soy sauce are used together in Pork Dumplings<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COOKING COOKIE CUTTER<|>PAPER TOWELS<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
