Line a shallow baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss the bananas, coconut oil, sugar, and salt. Spread the ingredients on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until caramelized. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely.\nPour the coconut and cashew milks in a tall (2-quart or larger) container and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 (60 grams) water and stir over low heat until the sugar has melted. Stir in the cocoa butter and coconut oil until melted. Stir in the salt until dissolved.\nGently pour the sugar mixture into the coconut milk mixture. Using an immersion blender, buzz the liquids together until emulsified. Add the roasted bananas and use an immersion blender to buzz the mixture until emulsified. Cover and refrigerate the ice cream base until chilled, for 1 to 2 hours. Do not refrigerate overnight. (If you must refrigerate overnight, “loosen” the solidified ice cream base by placing the container in a bowl with some warm water until it becomes more liquid.Pour the chilled ice cream base into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer, so you can use it to store ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles “soft serve.”While the ice cream churns, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F; position the rack in the middle\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n2. **Entity Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities.
