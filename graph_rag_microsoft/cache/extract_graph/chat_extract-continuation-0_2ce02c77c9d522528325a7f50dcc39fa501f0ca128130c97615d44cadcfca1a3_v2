Let soak overnight, then drain. Or use canned chickpeas, drained.\nPlace the drained, uncooked chickpeas and the onions in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the parsley, cilantro, salt, hot pepper, garlic, and cumin. Process until blended but not pureed.\nSprinkle in the baking powder and 4 tablespoons of the flour, and pulse. You want to add enough bulgur or flour so that the dough forms a small ball and no longer sticks to your hands. Turn into a bowl and refrigerate, covered, for several hours.\nForm the chickpea mixture into balls about the size of walnuts, or use a falafel scoop, available in Middle-Eastern markets.\nHeat 3 inches of oil to 375ºF in a deep pot or wok and fry 1 ball to test. If it falls apart, add a little flour. Then fry about 6 balls at once for a few minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Stuff half a pita with falafel balls, chopped tomatoes, onion, green pepper, and pickled turnips. Drizzle with tahina thinned with water.\nNOTE: Egyptians omit the cilantro and substitute fava beans for the chickpeas.\nTahina (also called tahini) is an oily paste made from ground sesame seeds. It is available in Middle Eastern markets and on Amazon. To garnish your falafel in true Israeli style, try adding one or several of the following condiments: harissa hot sauce, pickled turnip, mango amba (pickle\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MY FAVORITE FALAFEL<|>EVENT<|>My Favorite Falafel is a recipe for a Middle Eastern dish made from chickpeas and spices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKPEAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chickpeas are a type of legume commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sesame seeds are used to make tahina, an oily paste used in Middle Eastern cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGYPT<|>GEO<|>Egypt is a country where falafel is a popular dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISRAEL<|>GEO<|>Israel is a country where falafel is a popular dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDDLE EAST<|>GEO<|>The Middle East is a region where falafel is a popular dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is a city in Firuzabad where the Aurelians were being held)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is an Aurelian businessman who was held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is a Bratinas national and environmentalist who was held hostage in Firuzabad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is an Aurelian journalist who was held hostage in Firuzabad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is a prison in Tiruzia where Samuel Namara was held)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FAVORITE FALAFEL<|>CHICKPEAS<|>Chickpeas are a key ingredient in My Favorite Falafel<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FAVORITE FALAFEL<|>SESAME SEEDS<|>Tahina is made from sesame seeds and used in My Favorite Falafel<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGYPT<|>MY FAVOR"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
