We'll define a custom relationship extractor to identify relationships between organizations, people, and geographic locations.\n\n```python\n# Define a custom relationship extractor\ndef relationship_extractor(orgs, people, geo):\n    # Identify relationships between organizations\n    org_relationships = []\n    for org1 in orgs:\n        for org2 in orgs:\n            if org1.text != org2.text:\n                org_relationships.append((org1.text, org2.text, f\"{org1.text} is related to {org2.text}\"))\n    # Identify relationships between people\n    people_relationships = []\n    for person1 in people:\n        for person2 in people:\n            if person"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
