Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entities and their corresponding information.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    # Process the text\n    doc = nlp(text)\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the entities\n    entities = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities in the document\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        # Check if the entity type is in the list of entity types\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            # Extract the entity information\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n\n            # Format the entity as a string\n            entity = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}>|<{entity_description}>)\"\n\n            # Add the entity to the list\n            entities.append(entity)\n\n    return entities\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between the entities. We'll use a simple approach to identify related entities, such as entities that appear together in the same sentence.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the relationships\n    relationships = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            # Check if the entities appear together in the same sentence\n            if entities[i].split(\"<\")[1].split(\"|\")[0] in entities[j].split(\"<\")[1].split(\"|\")[0]:\n                # Extract the relationship information\n                source_entity = entities[i].split(\"<\")[1].split(\"|\")[0]\n                target_entity = entities[j].split(\"<\")[1].split(\"|\")[0]\n                relationship_description = f\"The entities {source_entity} and {target_entity} appear together in the same sentence.\"\n                relationship_strength = 1\n\n                # Format the relationship as a string\n                relationship = f\"({relationship_description}|<{source_entity}>|<{target_entity}>|<{relationship_strength}>\"\n\n                # Add the relationship to the", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763446114, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2261, "total_tokens": 2773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt', '8 (6\"-diameter) corn tortillas', '4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '12 oz. quesillo (Oaxaca cheese), coarsely grated', 'Chopped white onion, coarsely chopped cilantro, and lime wedges (for serving)']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace pork shoulder on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and freeze, uncovered, until almost completely frozen, about 2 hours. Using a very sharp knife, thinly slice pork (shoot for about ⅛\" thick). Transfer to a large bowl.\nMeanwhile, bring guajillo and morita chiles and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Cover, remove from heat, and let sit 30 minutes to allow chiles to soften.\nTransfer chiles and soaking liquid to a blender. Add garlic, orange juice, lime juice, achiote paste, and salt; purée until smooth. Pour over pork and toss to coat. Cover and let sit at room temperature 2 hours, or chill up to 6 hours.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Evenly space out tortillas on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted and very crisp (edges will curl and pucker), 35–45 minutes.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over high until smoking. Spread about one-fourth of pork across skillet in a single layer; cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath and cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter and wipe out skillet. Working in 3 batches, repeat process with remaining pork and 3 Tbsp. oil.\nIncrease oven temperature to 500°F. Divide pork among tostadas and top with quesillo; bake until cheese is melted, 8–10 minutes.
