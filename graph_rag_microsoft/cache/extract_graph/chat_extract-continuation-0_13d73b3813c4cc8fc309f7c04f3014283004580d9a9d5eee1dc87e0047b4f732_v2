Bring garlic, lemongrass, sugar, vinegar, red pepper flakes, cumin, black pepper, and 1/2 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring occasionally, and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8 minutes. Let cool and stir in fish sauce. Transfer half of sauce to a small bowl and set aside for serving.\nSeason chicken with salt. Place over indirect heat and cover grill with vent open (if you have one) and positioned over chicken. Grill, turning once or twice, until skin is browned and crisp and meat is nearly cooked through, 25–30 minutes. Uncover and move chicken to hotter part of grill. Continue to grill, turning often and basting with remaining sauce, until lacquered and lightly charred in places, 6–8 minutes longer. Serve with reserved sauce alongside.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GRILLED CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS WITH SAVORY CARAMEL<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Chicken Drumsticks with Savory Caramel is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used for grilling)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMONGRASS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemongrass is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RICE VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rice vinegar is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRUSHED RED PEPPER FLAKES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crushed red pepper flakes are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GROUND CUMIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ground cumin is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FISH SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fish sauce is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken drumsticks are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grill is a type of cooking device used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GAS GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gas grill is a type of grill used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHARCOAL GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charcoal grill is a type of grill"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
