We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = {\n    \"ORGANIZATION\": [\"headquartered_in\", \"founded_by\", \"owned_by\"],\n    \"PERSON\": [\"employed_by\", \"married_to\", \"has_child\"],\n    \"GEO\": [\"located_in\", \"borders\"],\n    \"EVENT\": [\"attended_by\", \"organized_by\"]\n}\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Shredded Beef in Guajillo Sauce (Carne Deshebrada en Salsa Roja )\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['3 pounds skirt steak', '1 white onion, quartered', '3 garlic cloves', '2 Turkish bay leaves or 1 California', '1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns', '3 whole allspice', '1 whole clove', '3/4 pound tomatoes (2 to 3 medium), quartered', '3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided', '3 ounces dried guajillo chiles, wiped clean', '1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns', '1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds', '3 whole allspice', '1 whole clove', '1/2 cup chopped white onion', '3 large garlic cloves', '3 to 5 dried chiles de árbol, wiped clean, stemmed, and seeded, or 1/2 teaspoon hot red-pepper flakes', 'Equipment: an electric coffee/spice grinder', 'Accompaniments: hot corn tortillas or rice; cooked black beans (rinsed and drained if canned); chopped white onion; lime wedges']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nPut all beef ingredients in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot with 1 teaspoon salt and enough water (", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763454696, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2260, "total_tokens": 2772, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
