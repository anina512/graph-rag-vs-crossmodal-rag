Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the crushed clove of garlic and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small heatproof bowl. Add the annatto seeds to the saucepan with the oil and cook until fragrant and browned and the oil turns orange, about 2 minutes. If you are using paprika instead of annatto seeds, cook it for only 15 seconds. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh wire strainer into the bowl with the garlic. Set the glaze aside.\n4. Prepare the dipping sauce: Place 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, if using, in 2 small attractive bowls. Have the limes ready; you'll add the lime juice at the last minute. (See Note.)\n5. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to medium. Leave one section of the grill bare for a safety zone.\n6. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade and arrange it on the hot grate or in an oiled grill basket, if using, skin side down. Grill the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes per side. Move the chicken as needed to dodge any flare-ups. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170°F. Alternatively, you can make a cut in the chicken meat where the thigh connects to the body; there should be no traces of red at the bone. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, start brushing the chicken on both sides with the glaze.\n7. To serve, transfer the chicken, skin side up, to a platter. Let it rest for about 2 minutes, then cut it into pieces with a cleaver. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to each bowl with the salt, pepper, and sugar for the dipping sauce and stir it with a fork or chopsticks until the salt and sugar dissolves. To eat, dip the pieces of chicken in the salted lime juice.\nKhmer Chicken Grilled Using the Indirect Method:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MARINATES<|>EVENT<|>Marinates is a cooking process that involves soaking food in a seasoned liquid to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICH FLAVOR<|>EVENT<|>Rich flavor is the result of the marinates process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken is the food being marinated)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>Glaze is a sauce made from oil, garlic, and annatto seeds used to add flavor to the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>PERSON<|>Oil is a key ingredient in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNATTO SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>Annatto seeds are a key ingredient in the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>GEO<|>Saucepan is a cooking vessel used to make the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEATPROOF BOWL<|>GEO<|>Heatproof bowl is a container used to hold the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH WIRE STRAINER<|>GEO<|>Fine-mesh wire strainer is a kitchen tool used to strain the glaze)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLICED LIME<|>GEO<|>Sliced lime is a key ingredient in the dipping sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the dipping sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Pepper is a key ingredient in the dipping sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Sugar is an optional ingredient in the dipping sauce)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARINATES<|>RICH FLAVOR<|>Marinates results in rich flavor<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>GLAZE<|>Chicken is brushed with the glaze during the last 10 minutes of cooking<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OIL<|>GARLIC<|>Oil and garlic are key ingredients in the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
