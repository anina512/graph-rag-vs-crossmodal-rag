Roll the dough to a 3/4-inch thickness.\n3. Dust a 2-inch cookie cutter or doughnut cutter with additional flour. Cut out circles and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you are using a cookie cutter, cut out 1/2-inch holes from the center of the disks. You can re-roll the scraps once to make more doughnuts.\n4.
