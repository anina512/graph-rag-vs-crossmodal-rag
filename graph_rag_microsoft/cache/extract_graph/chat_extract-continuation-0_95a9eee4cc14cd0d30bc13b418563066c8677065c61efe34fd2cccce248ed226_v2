Line several cookie sheets with wax paper. Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls. Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute. Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf. While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend. Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up. Repeat with the remaining leaves. If the candy becomes too thick, reheat in the microwave for several seconds, stirring frequently. Place the cookie sheets in the refrigerator until the candy is set, about 5 minutes.\nCarefully peel the leaves from the hardened candy. They come off surprisingly easily. Use a toothpick or clean tweezers to remove any small pieces of leaf that may remain. (The leaves and other candy pieces can be made up to 5 days in advance, covered, and kept in a cool dry place.)\nLine a cookie sheet with wax paper. Spoon the remaining milk chocolate into a small bowl to use for the acorn tops. Soften 4 or 5 caramels at a time in the microwave for 3 to 4 seconds. Roll each caramel into an acorn (egg) shape. Place the chocolate jimmies in a small shallow bowl. Reheat the milk chocolate in the microwave, stirring often, until smooth, about 10 seconds. Dip the large end of an acorn caramel into the melted chocolate to cover about 1/4 inch. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off. While the acorn is still wet, dip the chocolate end into the jimmies to coat. Transfer to the cookie sheet\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>AUTUMN LEAVES CUPCAKE WREATH<|>EVENT<|>Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath is a recipe for a cupcake wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate cupcakes are a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE LEAVES<|>EVENT<|>Maple leaves are a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE CANDY<|>EVENT<|>Orange candy is a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN CANDY<|>EVENT<|>Green candy is a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILK CHOCOLATE<|>EVENT<|>Milk chocolate is a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMELS<|>EVENT<|>Caramels are a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE JIMMIES<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate jimmies are a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate frosting is a key ingredient in the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN PAPER LINERS<|>EVENT<|>Brown paper liners are used to bake the chocolate cupcakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SUPPLY STORES<|>EVENT<|>Baking supply stores sell the necessary ingredients for the Autumn Leaves Cupcake Wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAX PAPER<|>EVENT<|>Wax paper is used to line the cookie sheets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Cookie sheets are used to bake the cupcake wreath)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROWAVABLE BOWLS<|>EVENT<|>Microwavable bowls are used to melt the candy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRAFT BRUSH<|>EVENT<|>A craft brush is used to paint the leaves"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
