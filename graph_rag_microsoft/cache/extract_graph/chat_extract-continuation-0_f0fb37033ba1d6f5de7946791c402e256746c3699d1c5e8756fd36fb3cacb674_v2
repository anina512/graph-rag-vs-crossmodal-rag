Stir until salt dissolves. Add hen halves and press to submerge. Refrigerate hens in brine, weighing down with heavy plate if needed, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.\nWhisk 1/2 cup lemon juice, oil, and sumac in medium bowl. Press in garlic cloves; season with pepper. Let dressing stand 15 minutes to thicken slightly, whisking occasionally.\nDrain hens. Pat dry with paper towels; arrange on large rimmed baking sheet. Using fingertips, loosen skin of breast meat on each hen half. Brush some dressing under skin onto breast meat of each hen; place lemon slice onto breast meat and pull skin over to cover. Brush hens all over with remaining dressing. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.\nPrepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Place hens, skin side up, on grill rack. Cover and grill until bottom sides are brown, about 8 minutes. Turn hens over; grill uncovered until skin sides brown, about 6 minutes. Continue to grill until hens are cooked through, turning occasionally, about 9 minutes longer. Transfer hens to platter. Serve with Date Relish.\n*Ground, dried, reddish-purple berries that grow wild throughout the Middle East; available at specialty foods stores and Middle Eastern markets.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CORNISH GAME HENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CORNISH GAME HENS are a type of poultry that can be used in a variety of dishes, including the one described in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LEMON is a type of citrus fruit that is often used in cooking and is a key ingredient in the Date Relish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUMAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SUMAC is a type of spice that is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine and is a key ingredient in the Date Relish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATE RELISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DATE RELISH is a type of condiment that is made with dates and is often served with grilled meats)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILLED CORNISH GAME HENS<|>EVENT<|>GRILLED CORNISH GAME HENS is a type of dish that is made by grilling Cornish game hens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARBECUE<|>EVENT<|>BARBECUE is a type of cooking method that involves grilling food over an open flame)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORNISH GAME HENS<|>DATE RELISH<|>CORNISH GAME HENS are often served with Date Relish<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMON<|>DATE RELISH<|>LEMON is a key ingredient in Date Relish<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUMAC<|>DATE RELISH<|>SUMAC is a key ingredient in Date Relish<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRILLED CORNISH GAME HENS<|>BARBECUE<|>GRILLED CORNISH GAME HENS are often cooked using the barbecue method<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
