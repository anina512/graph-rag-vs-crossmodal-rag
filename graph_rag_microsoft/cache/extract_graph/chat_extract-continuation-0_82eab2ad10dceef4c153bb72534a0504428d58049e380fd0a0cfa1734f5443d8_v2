Bring remaining 28 ounces stock to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and slowly whisk in stock-cornstarch mixture. Stir rapidly until stock is the consistency of olive oil. (It should cling to the back of a spoon.) Cool to room temperature, skim off and discard any film on top. Place cumin seeds in a dry sauté pan over medium-high heat. Stir until aroma of seeds is released, about 1 minute.\nBlend 1/4 cup stock in a blender with cumin seeds and remaining dressing ingredients until smooth. (Refrigerate or freeze leftover stock.) Heat oven to 350°F. Combine pecans, chili powder and oil in a mixing bowl; toss to coat pecans. Place nuts on a cookie sheet and roast until the aroma of the chili powder is released, 3 to 4 minutes. Combine dressing and slaw ingredients in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>RED CHILE AND PECAN SLAW<|>EVENT<|>Red Chile and Pecan Slaw is a recipe for a dish that combines the flavors of red chile and pecans)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE STOCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable stock is a type of stock used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>MAE PLOY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mae Ploy is a brand of sweet Thai chile sauce)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>APPLE CIDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple cider is a type of vinegar used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RICE WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rice wine is a type of vinegar used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cilantro is a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pecans are a type of nut used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RED CABBAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red cabbage is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN CABBAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Green cabbage is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN BELL PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Green bell pepper is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RED BELL PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red bell pepper is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW BELL PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yellow bell pepper is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>JALAPEÑO PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jalapeño pepper is a type of pepper used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOT<|>ORGAN"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
