Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n\n2. **Entity Type Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a rule-based approach to extract relationships based on the context in which entities appear.\n\n4. **Relationship Strength Scoring**: Assign a score to each relationship based on its strength. We'll use a simple scoring system based on the number of times entities appear together in the text.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationship extraction rules\nrelationship_rules = {\n    \"ORGANIZATION\": {\n        \"is_headed_by\": {\"pattern\": \"is headed by\", \"score\": 5},\n        \"has_committee\": {\"pattern\": \"has a committee\", \"score\": 3},\n        \"has_interest_rate\": {\"pattern\": \"has interest rate\", \"score\": 2},\n    },\n    \"PERSON\": {\n        \"is_chair\": {\"pattern\": \"is chair\", \"score\": 5},\n        \"is_journalist\": {\"pattern\": \"is a journalist\", \"score\": 3},\n        \"is_environmentalist\": {\"pattern\": \"is an environmentalist\", \"score\": 2},\n    },\n    \"GEO\": {\n        \"is_capital\": {\"pattern\": \"is the capital\", \"score\": 5},\n        \"is_country\": {\"pattern\": \"is a country\", \"score\": 3},\n        \"is_region\": {\"pattern\": \"is a region\", \"score\": 2},\n    },\n    \"EVENT\": {\n        \"is_hosted_by\": {\"pattern\": \"is hosted by\", \"score\": 5},\n        \"is_attended_by\": {\"pattern\": \"is attended by\", \"score\": 3},\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763455304, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2207, "total_tokens": 2719, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
