Coarsely chop the kale into 1-inch pieces. It will look like you have a lot of kale but it will cook down considerably.\nHeat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the tomatoes, shallot, garlic, thyme, and red pepper flakes, if using. Sauté until the tomatoes and shallot soften, about 4 minutes. Add the kale and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Toss with 2 wooden spoons until the kale wilts but is still bright green, about 2 minutes. Stir in the basil. Remove from the heat.\nFill a wide saucepan with enough water to measure 2 inches deep. Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Break each egg into a separate tea cup. Turn off the heat under the saucepan. Immediately slide each egg from its cup into a different part of the water (the whites will spread out). Let the eggs stand until the whites are set and the yolks are still very soft to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, using tongs, toast each tortilla directly over high heat until beginning to blacken in spots, about 15 seconds per side. Put the warm tortillas on plates. Spoon 1 tablespoon of hummus on each tortilla and spread to cover, leaving a 1-inch border. Divide the kale mixture over the hummus.\nUsing a slotted spoon, lift each egg from the water, wiping excess liquid from the bottom of the spoon with paper towels. Put the eggs on top of the kale. Slit the yolks and press on the eggs a bit so the yolks begin to run (this will make them\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>EVENT<|>Egg is a breakfast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KALE<|>EVENT<|>Kale is a breakfast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>EVENT<|>Tomato is a breakfast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUMMUS<|>EVENT<|>Hummus is a breakfast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOT<|>EVENT<|>Shallot is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>EVENT<|>Thyme is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED PEPPER FLAKES<|>EVENT<|>Red pepper flakes are a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Black pepper is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASIL<|>EVENT<|>Basil is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>EVENT<|>Wheat tortilla is a breakfast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is a cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGG<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>Egg is a breakfast food served on a wheat tortilla<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KALE<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>Kale is a breakfast food served on a wheat tortilla<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOMATO<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>Tomato is a breakfast food served on a wheat tortilla<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HUMMUS<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>Hummus is a breakfast food served on a wheat tortilla<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>WHEAT TORTILLA<|>Olive oil is a cooking ingredient used"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
