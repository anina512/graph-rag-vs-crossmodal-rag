Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all entities**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entity information and format it as required.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n            entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n    return entities\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities**\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between entities.
