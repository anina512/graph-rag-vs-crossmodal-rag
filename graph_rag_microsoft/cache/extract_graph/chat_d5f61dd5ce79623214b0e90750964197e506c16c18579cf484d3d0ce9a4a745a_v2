Add sugar and salt and cover with cold water. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to moderately high and simmer, uncovered, until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, then immediately plunge into ice water to stop cooking. Drain again and pat dry. DO AHEAD: The root vegetables can be prepared in advance and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 24 hours.\nPosition a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 275°F.\nTrim any excess fat from the lamb and sprinkle all sides with salt and pepper. In a large cast-iron pan or skillet over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil until smoking. Working in 3 or 4 batches (wipe the pan clean and add 1 tablespoon oil between batches), sear the lamb, turning with tongs, until golden brown on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer as done to a large roasting pan. Add the garlic, carrots, celery, onions, rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and lamb or beef stock. Place over high heat, using two burners, and bring to a simmer. Cover the roasting pan with foil, transfer to the oven, and roast until the meat is tender but not falling off the bone, about 2 hours.\nAllow the lamb to cool in its braising liquid for about 45 minutes.
