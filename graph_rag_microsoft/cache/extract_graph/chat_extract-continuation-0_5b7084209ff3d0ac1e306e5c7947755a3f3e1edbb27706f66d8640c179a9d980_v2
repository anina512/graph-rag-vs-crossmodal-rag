Cut each slice into 1-inch cubes and keep warm until ready to use.\nIn heavy, 12-inch, nonstick skillet over moderately high heat, heat olive oil until hot but not smoking. Add onion and saut until onions are translucent, about 1 minute. Stir in basil and cook 30 seconds more. Remove from heat.\nIn medium bowl, whisk together chickpea flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. In small bowl, whisk together egg and buttermilk. Add to dry ingredients and stir gently just until mixture is smooth, then gently fold in sautéed onion and basil. Let batter rest at room temperature 15 minutes.\nWipe skillet clean and heat over moderate heat until drop of water dropped into pan sizzles. Pour in batter and cook, turning over once, until light golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer pancake to cutting board and cut into quarters.\nIn large bowl, toss together lettuce, dressing, and croutons. Divide salad between 4 medium plates.
