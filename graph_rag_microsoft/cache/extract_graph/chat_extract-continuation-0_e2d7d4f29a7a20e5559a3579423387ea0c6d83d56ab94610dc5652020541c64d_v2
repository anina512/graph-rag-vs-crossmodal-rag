(If dough tears, mend hole by pressing surrounding dough together Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in warm place (75°F to 80°F, see Chef's Notes) until puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 475°F.\nIn medium saucepan over moderately high heat, combine potatoes, 4 sprigs thyme, garlic, salt, and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to moderately low and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are easily pierced with fork, about 20 minutes. Immediately drain, discarding thyme sprigs and garlic. When cool enough to handle, slice potatoes into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and reserve.

Add mushrooms and sauté 1 minute. Add shallots and sauté until light golden brown and soft, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, then transfer to paper-towel-lined plate and reserve. (Mushrooms can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 24 hours.)\nArrange potato slices on flatbread, then brush with olive oil and sprinkle with thyme leaves. Spread mushroom mixture on top, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons white truffle oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Bake, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through, until crust is light golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes.\nWhile flatbread bakes, in small bowl, whisk together crème fraîche and remaining 2 tablespoons truffle oil.\nTransfer flatbread to large cutting board and let cool about 5 minutes. Drizzle with truffle oil–infused crème fraˆhe and sprinkle with chives.
