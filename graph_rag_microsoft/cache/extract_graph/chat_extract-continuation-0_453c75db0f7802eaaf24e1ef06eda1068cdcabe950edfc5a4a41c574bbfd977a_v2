Line 2 large cookie sheets and with parchment paper or silicone sheets.\nIn a large bowl, combine the butter, sugar, vanilla and salt at medium-low speed just until smooth. Add the flours and mix until just blended. Divide the dough in half and then shape, without over handling, into 2 disks.\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll 1 piece of dough out into a 13-inch, 1/4-inch-thick square. Using a ruler and a fluted pastry wheel or a large knife, trim the edges and cut into 2- by 1-inch rectangles. Transfer the cookies to the baking sheets, spacing 1 1/2 inches apart. Reroll the scraps and repeat with the remaining dough. Mark each cookie several times with tines of a fork and then chill the pans in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. Bake cookies for about 17 minutes, until golden and nearly firm in center. Let cool for 5 minutes on baking sheets and transfer to racks to cool completely.\nFinely chop semisweet chocolate. Place half of the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan with 1 inch of simmering water and stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Add the remaining chocolate to the bowl; remove the bowl from the pot and place on a folded towel. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth. Scrape the chocolate into a small bowl. Line a baking sheet with clean parchment or waxed paper. Dip the cookies halfway into the chocolate, let the excess drip off, and then place on the paper-lined sheet; let stand until set and dry, at least 1 hour.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHEAT BISCUIT SHORTBREAD<|>EVENT<|>Wheat Biscuit Shortbread is a recipe for a type of cookie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla extract is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE SALT<|>EVENT<|>Fine salt is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNBLEACHED ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Unbleached all-purpose flour is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE WHOLE-WHEAT FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>White whole-wheat flour is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE<|>EVENT<|>Semisweet chocolate is an ingredient in Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Cookie sheets are used in the baking of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>The oven is used in the baking of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>EVENT<|>Parchment paper is used in the baking of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILICONE SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Silicone sheets are used in the baking of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACKS<|>EVENT<|>Racks are used in the cooling of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Baking sheets are used in the baking of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORK<|>EVENT<|>A fork is used in the preparation of Wheat Biscuit Shortbread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOPPER<|>EVENT<|>A"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
