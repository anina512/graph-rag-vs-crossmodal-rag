Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.\nIn a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture.

Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.\nIn a large skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking fat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until golden, about 15 minutes.
