Refrigerate the remaining 2 whites for another use.\nIn a cold medium skillet, combine the oil, garlic, peperoncini, and oregano. Turn on the heat and warm over medium-high heat until the garlic begins to fry (without browning) and the mixture becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes.\nRaise the heat to high, then use your hands to crush each tomato into the pan, allowing the juice to fall into the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Fry the tomatoes, continuing to break them up with the fork. Cook until they concentrate and no longer look watery, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the basil.\nLower the heat to medium and stir in the egg whites. Cook until the whites become opaque and firm, thickening the tomato sauce, about 1 minute.\nTurn off the heat. Using the back of a spoon, make 4 indentations in the sauce, allowing a few inches around each. Slip an egg yolk into each indentation. Draw the sauce in from the edges of the pan around each of the yolks. Cover the skillet and leave it on the stove, heat off, until the yolks are just warmed through and beginning to set, about 3 minutes for runny yolks.\nGently spoon some sauce and a yolk onto each piece of toast and serve immediately. I find rubbing some olive oil on the spoon helps prevent breaking the yolk.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS WITH TOMATO ON TOAST<|>EVENT<|>Eggs with Tomato on Toast is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>EVENT<|>Tomato is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOAST<|>EVENT<|>Toast is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEPERONCINI<|>EVENT<|>Peperoncini is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OREGANO<|>EVENT<|>Oregano is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CANNED TOMATOES<|>EVENT<|>Canned tomatoes are used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BASIL<|>EVENT<|>Basil is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>COUNTRY WHITE BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Country white bread is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Black pepper is used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>EGGS WITH TOMATO ON TOAST<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the recipe<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>TOMATO<|>EGGS WITH TOMATO ON TOAST<|>Tomato is a key ingredient in the recipe<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>TOAST<|>EGGS WITH TOMATO ON TOAST<|>Toast is a key ingredient in the recipe<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EGGS WITH TOMATO ON TOAST<|>Olive oil is used in the recipe<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
