Add egg mixture to dry ingredients and whisk to combine (batter will be slightly lumpy).\nHeat a large griddle or 2 cast-iron or nonstick skillets over medium; brush with butter. Working in batches, scoop 1/2-cupfuls of batter onto griddle; cook until bubbles form on the surface and pop and the underside is golden brown, 2 1/2–3 minutes. Flip and continue to cook until golden brown on the bottom, 2–2 1/2 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to plates or a platter and brush tops with butter.
