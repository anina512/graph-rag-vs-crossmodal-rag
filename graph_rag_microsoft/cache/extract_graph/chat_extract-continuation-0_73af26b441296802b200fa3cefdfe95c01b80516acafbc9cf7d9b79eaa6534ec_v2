Remove from the heat and stir in the sumac. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it steep for 30 minutes, no more. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh strainer over a medium bowl and chill before ready to serve.\nTo serve, fill four tall glasses with ice. In a large pitcher, stir the syrup with the chilled club soda or water. Pour 1 cup (120 ml) of the drink into each glass. Garnish each glass with 1 or 2 saffron strands. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\nSumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>SUMAC AND SAFFRON REFRESHER<|>EVENT<|>Sumac and Saffron Refresher is a recipe for a refreshing drink)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SAFFRON<|>EVENT<|>Saffron is a key ingredient in the Sumac and Saffron Refresher recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUMAC<|>EVENT<|>Sumac is a key ingredient in the Sumac and Saffron Refresher recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CLUB SODA<|>EVENT<|>Club soda is used to add acidity and a second note of flavor to the Sumac and Saffron Refresher)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN CARDAMOM<|>EVENT<|>Green cardamom is used to add flavor to the Sumac and Saffron Refresher)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is used to add sweetness to the Sumac and Saffron Refresher)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used to steep the sumac and saffron in the Sumac and Saffron Refresher recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUMAC AND SAFFRON REFRESHER<|>EVENT<|>Sumac and Saffron Refresher is a refreshing drink made with saffron, sumac, sugar, and water)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SAFFRON<|>EVENT<|>Saffron is a key ingredient in the Sumac and Saffron Refresher recipe and is ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUMAC<|>EVENT<|>Sumac is a key ingredient in the Sumac and Saffron Refresher recipe and is steeped in water to release its flavor and color)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CLUB SODA<|>EVENT<|>Club soda is used to add acidity and a second note of flavor to the Sumac and Saffron Refresher)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN CARDAMOM<|>EVENT<|>Green cardamom is used to add flavor to the Sumac and Saffron Refresher)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is used to add sweetness to"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
