We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nNut Butter Granola Bars\n\nIngredients:\n['2 cups raw nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, pistachios, pecans, and/or blanched hazelnuts)', '½ cup raw pumpkin seeds', '3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan', '2 cups old-fashioned oats, divided', '1¼ cups dried fruit (such as tart cherries, raisins, currants, dates, apricots, and/or blueberries)', '¾ cup unsalted or low-salt natural peanut butter', '½ cup plus 2 Tbsp. honey', '2 tsp. kosher salt', '2 tsp. vanilla extract', '1 large egg white']\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat oven to 350°F.

Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Toast nuts pumpkin seeds on a rimmed baking sheet until golden brown or slightly darkened in color, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a food processor and let sit until cool enough to handle.\nReduce oven temperature to 300°F. Lightly oil 13x9\" pan and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on both long sides.

Add peanut butter, but don’t stir it in; set aside.\nBring honey, salt, and vanilla to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat (it will bubble up). Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until it is foaming vigorously and smells like caramel, about 3 minutes.\nImmediately pour honey mixture over peanut butter in reserved bowl (it will melt the peanut butter). Stir to combine, making sure to aggressively break up any clumps.\nUsing a fork or small whisk, lightly beat egg white in a small bowl to thin out. Add to oat mixture and mix until egg white is no longer visible.\nScrape oat mixture into prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. (Be sure to really compact the mixture into the pan—it helps to use the bottom of a heavy glass or metal measuring cup.)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5e9aafdd9ebbb908d2ddc333ac473a3713b2ee1c9409e9ad743bfa2ee9c69391_v2"}
