Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll also use the `en_core_web_sm` model, which is a small English model that's suitable for this task.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the entities\nentities = []\n\n# Iterate over the entities in the document\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    # Extract the entity name, type, and description\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n\n    # Format the entity as a string\n    entity = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}>{entity_description})\"\n\n    # Add the entity to the list\n    entities.append(entity)\n\n# Print the entities\nprint(\"##\".join(entities))\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll use the `spacy` library to perform entity disambiguation and relation extraction on the text.
