Melt the lard in a 5-quart pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. Add the turkey and place in oven. Turn turkey pieces every 30 minutes and cook until turkey is tender and a paring knife can easily be inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. Carefully remove the skin from turkey pieces and reserve. Shred the meat and reserve.\nBring the vinegar, sugar, salt, and 1 cup water to a boil and stir until dissolved. Place peaches, mustard seeds, and thyme in a heatproof glass container and pour vinegar mixture over. Let sit until mixture comes to room temperature, then refrigerate 1 hour.\nDice the chilled peaches and combine with the onion, cilantro, lemon, olive oil, and salt. Taste and adjust seasoning.\nToast the chiles in a dry skillet over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Let cool and remove stems and seeds. Bring 1 cup water to a boil and pour over chiles. Steep until tender, about 5 minutes. Purée the chiles, water, garlic, onion, sugar, and salt in a blender until smooth, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TURKEY LEG CONFIT TACO<|>EVENT<|>Turkey Leg Confit Taco is a dish with Pasilla Purée and Pickled Peach Salsa)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASILLA PURÉE<|>EVENT<|>Pasilla Purée is a sauce made from pasilla chiles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PICKLED PEACH SALSA<|>EVENT<|>Pickled Peach Salsa is a topping made from peaches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Turkey is a type of poultry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pasilla is a type of chile pepper)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peach is a type of fruit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE CIDER VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Cider Vinegar is a type of vinegar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher Salt is a type of salt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW MUSTARD SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yellow Mustard Seeds are a type of spice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thyme is a type of herb)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red Onion is a type of onion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cilantro is a type of herb)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon Juice is a type of citrus juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive Oil is a type of oil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable Oil is a type of oil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNUCOPIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornucopia is a type of dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVOCADO<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
