Reduce speed to low; gradually add powdered sugar. Increase speed to medium and beat until mixture falls back on itself in a thick, barely dissolving ribbon, about 2 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Set aside 3/4 cup marshmallow fluff in a small bowl; reserve remaining fluff for another use.\nHeat granulated sugar, cream of tartar, and remaining 2 egg whites in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water), whisking constantly, until mixture is warm (not hot) and sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes (rub a bit between your fingers to check; it should be free of grit).\nUsing an electric mixer on high speed, beat until stiff, glossy peaks form and the sides of bowl are cool to the touch, 5–7 minutes. Add reserved marshmallow fluff to meringue and beat just to combine. Dollop marshmallow topping over top of cooled pie filling and use a spatula to spread, creating decorative peaks and swirls. Use a kitchen torch to toast marshmallow topping, if desired. Decorate with chocolate chips.\nPie (without marshmallow topping) can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool, then store covered at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An electric mixer is a kitchen appliance used for mixing and beating ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORN SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Corn syrup is a sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg white is a component of eggs used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWDERED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Powdered sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla is a flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARSHMALLOW FLUFF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Marshmallow fluff is a sweet spread used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Granulated sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM OF TARTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream of tartar is a component used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A saucepan is a kitchen vessel used for heating ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bowl is a kitchen vessel used for mixing and serving ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE FILLING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pie filling is a component used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate chips are a type of candy used for decorating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TORCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A kitchen torch is a kitchen appliance used for toasting ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pie is a type of baked dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Room temperature is a condition used for storing baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAY<|>EVENT<|>A day is a unit of time used for planning and scheduling)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>CORN SYRUP<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
