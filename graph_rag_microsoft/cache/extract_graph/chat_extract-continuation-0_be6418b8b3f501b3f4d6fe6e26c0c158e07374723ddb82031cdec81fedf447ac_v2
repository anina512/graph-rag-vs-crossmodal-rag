Gradually, drizzle in the ice water while pulsing. The amount needed will depend on the moisture content of the flour. Add just enough water for the dough to form a loose ball. Turn the pastry out onto a lightly floured surface and quickly form the dough into a 1-inch-thick disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or up to three days) to rest. Preheat oven to 375 degrees about 20 minutes before you're planning to bake the tart.\nMeanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the bacon in a single layer and cook, turning as needed, until the bacon is crispy and the fat has been rendered. Remove the bacon to drain on paper towels to cool, chopping coarsely once cool enough to handle. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat (discarding the rest or using for another purpose) in the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, salt, pepper, and thyme. Cook over medium heat until the onions have softened, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Do not let the onions brown!\nAdd the wine and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook until the wine has cooked down to a glaze, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the honey and reserved chopped bacon. Stir and cook 5 minutes more. Remove the onion mixture from the heat and spoon into a shallow pan; refrigerate to cool. When cooled, drain off any excess pan juices and stir\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VIDALIA ONION TART<|>EVENT<|>Vidalia Onion Tart is a dish made with Vidalia onions, bacon, and honey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACON<|>EVENT<|>Bacon is a key ingredient in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL HONEY<|>EVENT<|>Local honey is used in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH THYME<|>EVENT<|>Fresh thyme is used in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>EVENT<|>Vidalia onions are a key ingredient in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>All-purpose flour is used to make the pastry for the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD, UNSWEETENED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Cold, unsweetened butter is used to make the pastry for the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE WATER<|>EVENT<|>Ice water is used to make the pastry for the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>EVENT<|>Egg is used in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Whole cream is used in the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIDALIA ONION TART PAN<|>EVENT<|>Vidalia Onion Tart pan is used to bake the Vidalia Onion Tart)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACON<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>Bacon is paired with Vidalia onions in the Vidalia Onion Tart<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCAL HONEY<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>Local honey is paired with Vidalia onions in the Vidalia Onion Tart<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRESH THYME<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>Fresh thyme is paired with Vidalia onions in the Vidalia Onion Tart<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>COLD, UNSWEETENED BUTTER<|>All-purpose flour and cold, unsweetened butter are used to make the pastry for the Vid"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
