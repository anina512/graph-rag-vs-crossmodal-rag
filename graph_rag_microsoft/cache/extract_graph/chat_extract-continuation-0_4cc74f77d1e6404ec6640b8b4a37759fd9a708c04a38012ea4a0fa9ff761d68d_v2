Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.\nThe next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.\nWhen the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.\nTo serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.\nThe pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame. The sugars in the marinade will char and caramelize, giving you a more interesting texture and flavor, but be careful not to burn the pork.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SPICY PORK BELLY SLIDERS<|>EVENT<|>Spicy Pork Belly Sliders is a dish made with pork belly, gochujang, and other ingredients)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GOCHUJANG<|>EVENT<|>Gochujang is a Korean red chili paste used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Soy sauce is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MINCED GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Minced garlic is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAKE<|>EVENT<|>Sake is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MIRIN<|>EVENT<|>Mirin is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOASTED SESAME OIL<|>EVENT<|>Toasted sesame oil is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PORK BELLY<|>EVENT<|>Pork belly is the main ingredient in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SLIDER BUNS<|>EVENT<|>Slider buns are used to serve Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>EVENT<|>Mayonnaise is used to serve Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ENGLISH CUCUMBERS<|>EVENT<|>English cucumbers are used to serve Spicy Pork Belly Sliders)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SPICY PORK BELLY SLIDERS<|>GOCHUJANG<|>Gochujang is a key ingredient in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SPICY PORK BELLY SLIDERS<|>SOY SAUCE<|>Soy sauce is an ingredient used in Spicy Pork Belly Sliders<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SPICY PORK BELLY SLIDERS<|>MINCED GARLIC<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
