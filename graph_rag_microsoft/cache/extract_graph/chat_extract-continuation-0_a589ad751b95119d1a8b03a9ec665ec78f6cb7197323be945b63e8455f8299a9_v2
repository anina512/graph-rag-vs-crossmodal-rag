This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.\nBefore the coating sets, attach a Tic Tac in position for the nose and an Oreo cookie half on top for the hat. Attach two 1 1/2-inch licorice wheel sections on either side of the witch's head for hair. Hold them in place until the candy coating sets like glue, and place in the Styrofoam block to dry. You can add more coating on the sides to attach the pieces if the coating sets too fast.\nWhen the pops are dry, use a toothpick to dot a small amount of melted candy coating in position for the eyes, and attach 2 orange jimmies on each cake pop.\nTo finish the hats, tear off the paper sticking out of each Hershey's Kiss, and use a toothpick to apply a small amount of coating on the center of the Oreo hat bottom. Attach the wrapped chocolate candy in place and let dry.\nDraw mouths with a black edible-ink pen, and let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.\nThe hats are delicate and may not do well if you will be transporting or wrapping them. They would be better served at a home Halloween gathering.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BASE OF THE STICK<|>GEO<|>The base of the stick is where the lollipop is built up)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FINGER<|>PERSON<|>A finger is used to wipe off the lollipop stick)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LOLLIPOP STICK<|>GEO<|>The lollipop stick is spun while wiping off the coating)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TIC TAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Tic Tac is used as the nose of the witch)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OREO COOKIE HALF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An Oreo cookie half is used as the hat of the witch)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LICORICE WHEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Licorice wheels are used as the hair of the witch)\n## (\"entity\"<|>STYROFOAM BLOCK<|>GEO<|>The Styrofoam block is used to dry the candy coating)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>PERSON<|>A toothpick is used to apply melted candy coating)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGE JIMMIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange jimmies are used as the eyes of the witch)\n## (\"entity\"<|>HERSHEY'S KISS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A Hershey's Kiss is used as the hat of the witch)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BLACK EDIBLE-INK PEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A black edible-ink pen is used to draw mouths)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>FINGER<|>LOLLIPOP STICK<|>A finger is used to wipe off the lollipop stick<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>LOLLIPOP STICK<|>BASE OF THE STICK<|>The lollipop stick is built up at the base of the stick<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>TIC TAC<|>OREO COOKIE HALF<|>A Tic Tac is used as the nose of the witch, and an Oreo cookie half is used as the hat<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OREO COOKIE HALF<|>HERSHEY'S KISS<|>An Oreo cookie half is used as the hat, and a Hershey's Kiss is"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
