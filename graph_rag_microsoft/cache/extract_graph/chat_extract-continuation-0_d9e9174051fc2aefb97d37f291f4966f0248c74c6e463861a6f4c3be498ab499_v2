Toast sesame seeds in a shallow baking pan in oven, stirring occasionally, until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer 2 tablespoons seeds to a small bowl and 1/4 cup to grinder. Transfer remaining 3/4 cup to a wide shallow bowl.\nHalve 3 zucchini crosswise, then cut lengthwise into 3/4-inch shoestrings using slicer. Toss with 1 teaspoon salt in a large sieve set over a bowl and drain 30 minutes.\nSqueeze handfuls of zucchini to remove moisture, then roll up in a triple layer of paper towels and squeeze to remove remaining moisture.\nFinely chop tuna with a large wet knife (about 3/4-inch pieces). Stir together soy sauce, 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl, then stir in tuna. Divide tuna mixture into 4 portions. Pack 1 portion in a 1/2-cup measure, then invert onto seeds in shallow bowl. Gently press tuna to form a patty 3 1/2 inches in diameter, then coat completely with seeds and transfer to a wax-paper-lined plate. Form, coat, and transfer 3 more burgers in same manner. Chill, covered with plastic wrap, until ready to cook. Discard any sesame seeds remaining in shallow bowl.\nGrind seeds that are already in grinder, pulsing until ground to a flour, then add to remaining seeds (2 tablespoons) in small bowl.\nRemove julienne attachment from slicer, then cut remaining zucchini lengthwise into 3/4-inch-thick ribbons using slicer. Gently toss with 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl and set aside (zucchini will wilt and become tender).\nHeat 1 inch\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and entity recognition.
