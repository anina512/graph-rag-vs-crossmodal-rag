Divide the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces. (A typical bagel is about 4 ounces or 113 grams before baking, but you can make them smaller. If you make more than 6 bagels, you may need to prepare 2 sheet pans.) Form each piece into a loose ball by rolling it on a clean, dry work surface with a cupped hand. (Don’t use any flour on the work surface. If the dough slides around and won’t ball up, wipe the surface with a damp paper towel and try again; the slight bit of moisture will provide enough traction for the dough to form into a ball.) There are two methods to shape the balls into bagels.\nThe first method is to poke a hole through the center of the ball to create a donut shape. Holding the dough with both thumbs in the hole, rotate the dough with your hands, gradually stretching it to create a hole about 2 inches in diameter.\nThe second method, preferred by professional bagel makers, is to use both hands (and a fair amount of pressure) to roll the ball into a rope about 8 inches long on a clean, dry work surface. (Again, wipe the surface with a damp towel, if necessary, to create sufficient friction on the work surface.) Taper the rope slightly at each end and moisten the last inch or so of the ends. Place one end of the dough in the palm of your hand and wrap the rope around your hand to complete the circle, going between your thumb and forefinger and then all the way around. The ends should overlap by about 2 inches. Squeeze the overlapping ends together by closing your hand, then press the seam into the work surface, rolling it back and forth a few times to seal. Remove the dough from your hand, squeezing it to even out the thickness if need be and creating a hole of about 2 inches in diameter.\nPlace each shaped bagel on the prepared sheet pan, then mist with spray oil or brush with a\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BAGELS<|>EVENT<|>Bagels are a type of baked good that can be made at home with a simple recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>EVENT<|>Dough is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients that is used to make bagels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is a key ingredient in making dough for bagels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>EVENT<|>Room temperature is necessary for the dough to rise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>EVENT<|>Plastic wrap is used to cover the bowl containing the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHEET PAN<|>EVENT<|>A sheet pan is used to bake the bagels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>EVENT<|>Parchment paper is used to line the sheet pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SILICONE MAT<|>EVENT<|>A silicone mat is used to line the sheet pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRAY OIL<|>EVENT<|>Spray oil is used to mist the sheet pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>EVENT<|>Oil is used to lightly coat the sheet pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>No information available)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAGELS<|>DOUGH<|>Bagels are made from dough<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOUGH<|>FLOUR<|>Dough is made from flour<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>DOUGH<|>Dough needs to be at room temperature to rise<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>DOUGH<|>Plastic wrap is used to cover the dough<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SHEET PAN<|>BAGELS<|>Bagels are baked on a sheet pan<|>9)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
