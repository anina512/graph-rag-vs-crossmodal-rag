Using slotted spoon, transfer to large bowl. Proceed with recipe, adding ingredients to bowl with sausage and substituting 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage for dried rosemary and sage.\nDried Apricot and Pecan Stuffing: Dried fruit are better than fresh in stuffing because the latter get soggy with long baking. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spread 1½ cups (6 ounces) pecans on rimmed baking sheet and toast, stirring occasionally, until browned and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Cool and coarsely chop. In medium bowl, combine 1½ cups diced dried apricots and hot water to cover. Soak until apricots plump, about 30 minutes, then drain well. Proceed with recipe, tossing apricots and pecans with other ingredients in large bowl.\nTest-Kitchen Tips: Warm, moist stuffing is an optimal environment for bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli to multiply, so it's important to follow safe procedures. Be sure to make the stuffing at the last minute so it can go into the bird warm. This helps it move above the \"danger zone\" (the optimal temperature range for bacteria growth) more quickly during roasting. Stuffing baked outside of the turkey can be spread in the baking dish and refrigerated for a few hours while the turkey roasts, but it should be prepared on the same day as baking.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PORK SAUSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pork sausage is a type of meat product made from ground pork and seasonings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BULK PORK SAUSAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bulk pork sausage is a type of pork sausage sold in bulk quantities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A spoon is a kitchen utensil used for stirring and serving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A heavy skillet is a type of cooking vessel made from metal or other materials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODERATE HEAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Moderate heat is a temperature range used for cooking certain types of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED ROSEMARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dried rosemary is a type of herb used for flavoring food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED APRICOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dried apricots are a type of dried fruit used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pecans are a type of nut used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIMMED BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rimmed baking sheet is a type of baking sheet with a raised edge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A medium bowl is a type of kitchen vessel used for mixing and serving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A large bowl is a type of kitchen vessel used for mixing and serving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEST-KITCHEN TIPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Test-kitchen tips are advice and guidelines for cooking and food safety)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMONELLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E.
