Mix in all cheeses, tomatoes, thyme, marjoram, and pepper. Cover and chill until ready to use, up to 1 day.\nStack phyllo sheets. Using sharp knife or shears, cut sheets in half lengthwise, making sixteen 5- to 6-inch-wide pastry strips. Place 1 strip on work surface (keep remaining strips covered with plastic wrap and damp towel to prevent drying). Brush entire strip with oil. Place 1 heaping tablespoon cheese filling in center of strip, 1 inch in from 1 short pastry edge. Shape filling into 3-inch-long log, parallel to short edge. Fold short edge, then sides of pastry, over filling. Continue to roll up, enclosing filling completely. Brush all over with oil; place on rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo strips and filling. Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Bake rolls uncovered until filling is heated through and pastry is golden, about 18 minutes. Transfer to platter; serve hot.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHEESE, HERB, AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO PHYLLO ROLLS<|>EVENT<|>Cheese, Herb, and Sun-Dried Tomato Phyllo Rolls is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KEFALOTYRI CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kefalotyri cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KASSERI CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kasseri cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FETA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Feta cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUN-DRIED TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sun-dried tomatoes are an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thyme is an herb used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MARJORAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Marjoram is an herb used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE OR BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White or black pepper is a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PHYLLO PASTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Phyllo pastry is a type of pastry used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Extra-virgin olive oil is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>KEFALOTYRI CHEESE<|>KASSERI CHEESE<|>Kefalotyri cheese and Kasseri cheese are both types of cheese used in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>KEFALOTYRI CHEESE<|>FETA CHEESE<|>Kefalotyri cheese and Feta cheese are both types of cheese used in the recipe<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>KASSERI"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
