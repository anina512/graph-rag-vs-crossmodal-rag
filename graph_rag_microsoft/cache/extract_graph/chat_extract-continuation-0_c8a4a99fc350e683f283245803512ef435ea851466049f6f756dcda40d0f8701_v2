Add black gel food coloring, if using, a few drops at a time, until desired color is achieved.\nSpoon 1 cup pumpkin batter into center of each prepared pan. Spoon 1/2 cup chocolate batter directly on top of pumpkin batter. Repeat 2 times with each batter, spooning batter into centers of pans and occasionally tapping pan firmly on work surface to ensure even distribution. Divide remaining chocolate batter into centers of both pans. The batter will look slightly domed at this point; carefully smooth with an offset spatula, being careful not to disturb the layers too much.\nBake cakes until centers spring back when lightly pressed, 55–60 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cakes cool.\nPlace chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium. Bring to a low simmer, then immediately pour over chocolate. Let sit, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Add vanilla and whisk until smooth. Add black gel food coloring, if using, to achieve a scary black frosting. Let ganache cool at room temperature until thick, about 30 minutes.\nPlace 2 wooden-handled spoons or spatulas horizontally about 5\" apart over a large bowl. Prepare an ice bath in a medium bowl.\nHeat sugar, corn syrup, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small saucepan fitted with candy thermometer over medium, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium heat, without stirring, brushing any sugar crystals down side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook until thermometer registers 300°F. Immediately dip bottom of pan in ice bath, stirring with a fork. The sugar is ready once it thickens to the consistency of honey but still flows in a steady stream. Remove pan from ice bath and dip fork in hot sugar. Raise fork about 10\" above the wooden spatulas and quickly move the fork back and forth, making thin threads of sugar. Repeat, dipping fork back into hot sugar and layering the strands. Form enough strands to create a loose mass resembling a spider web.\nSpread 1 Tbsp. ganache in the center of a platter. Place 1 cake layer in the center. Evenly spread 1 1/2 cups ganache on top of cake with an offset spatula, pressing outward toward edges.
