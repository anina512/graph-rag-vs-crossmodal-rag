Uncover the dough. With lightly oiled hands, punch the dough down to release air. Cover again with the bag, loosely tucked under, and let rise for 1 hour.\n5. Divide the dough into five equal parts, about 2 pounds each. Preheat oven to 375°F. Spray five 9-inch round baking pans with cooking spray.\n6. Place one piece of dough on a smooth work surface. Squeeze out any air bubbles from the dough and roll in into a 12-inch rope. If the dough is sticking, lightly spray your work surface with cooking spray. Cut the rope into eight equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Place one ball in the center of the prepared pan and surround it with the remaining balls. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough so you have five pans of challah. Loosely cover each pan with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise 15 minutes. (If you can't fit all the pans in your oven at once and you want your challahs to be as beautiful as possible, shape the remaining dough while the first round of challahs are in the oven so they don't see rise for too much longer than 15 minutes before baking.)\n7. Beat the egg whites with 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl and brush the challahs. Sprinkle each with sesame or poppy seeds or a combination of the two.\n8. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake until tops are dark golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes more. Let cool 15 minutes before serving warm, or cool completely on a wire rack.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The dough is a mixture of ingredients that needs to be kneaded and risen)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHALLAH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Challah is a type of bread that is made from the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is an ingredient used in the challah recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Seeds are used to decorate the challah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The oven is used to bake the challah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORK SURFACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The work surface is used to roll out the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The kitchen towel is used to cover the challah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The plastic wrap is used to cover the challah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The wire rack is used to cool the challah)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is not in the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
