Repeat 2 times. Using a paring knife, trim the ends and scrape the stems, removing the outer layer. Let dry thoroughly on paper towels at room temperature or uncovered in your refrigerator—this could take up to a couple of hours and can be done the day before.\nIn a large sauté pan over high heat, heat the 1 teaspoon oil. Add the mushrooms and cook until browned. Reduce the heat to medium and add the port, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom. Reduce until the liquid is a syrupy consistency, about 10 minutes.\nIn a food processor fitted with a steel blade, puree the chicken cubes and livers; slowly add the egg whites, then the cream. Mix until thoroughly combined. Pass the poultry puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. Roughly chop the cooled mushrooms and add (with any residual juice) to the bowl with the poultry puree.\nPreheat the oven to 325°F. Season the quail inside and out with salt.\nScoop the poultry puree into a pastry piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch round tip or a large plastic storage bag with one 1/2-inch corner snipped. Pipe puree into each quail body and tie the legs together with butcher's twine.\nHeat a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed ovenproof sauté pan over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and brown the quail on all sides. You may need to work in batches. Transfer the pan to the oven (use two pans or transfer to a large roasting pan if necessary) and roast the quail for 30 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the quail registers 155°F. Let rest in the pan for\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROASTED QUAIL WITH WILD MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms is a dish that combines roasted quail with wild mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Wild mushrooms are a key ingredient in Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAIL<|>EVENT<|>Quail is a key ingredient in Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Wild mushrooms are a key ingredient in Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE PORT<|>EVENT<|>White port is used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN BREASTS<|>EVENT<|>Chicken breasts are used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAIL LIVERS<|>EVENT<|>Quail livers are used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>EVENT<|>Egg whites are used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the preparation of Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROASTED QUAIL WITH WILD MUSHROOMS<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>Wild mushrooms are a key ingredient in Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROASTED QUAIL WITH WILD MUSHROOMS<|>QUAIL<|>Quail is a key ingredient in Roasted Quail with Wild Mushrooms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>OLIVE OIL<|>Olive"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
