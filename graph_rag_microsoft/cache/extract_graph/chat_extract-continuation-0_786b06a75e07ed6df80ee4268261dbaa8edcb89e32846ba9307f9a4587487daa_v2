Stir well to combine, then add the cauliflower on top without stirring, making sure that the cauliflower layer completely covers the pasta for even cooking. Secure the lid and move the steam release valve to Sealing. Select Manual/ Pressure Cook to cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. While the pot is coming to pressure, shred the Cheddar (you should have about 1 cup, tightly packed).\nWhen the cooking cycle is complete, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes, then move the steam release valve to Venting to release any remaining pressure.\nWhen the floating valve drops, remove the lid and stir the pasta well, using a spatula to break up any pasta that has stuck together or stuck to the bottom of the pot. (A little sticking is to be expected, but it will loosen up when you stir.) Use the spatula to mash any intact cauliflower florets against the side of the pot to help them dissolve into the pasta sauce.\nAdd the Cheddar and parmesan and stir well. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed and serve warm. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 4 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant Pot is a brand of electric pressure cooker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACARONI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Macaroni is a type of pasta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAULIFLOWER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cauliflower is a type of vegetable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheese is a type of dairy product)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN CAULIFLOWER MAC ‘N’ CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Hidden Cauliflower Mac ‘n’ Cheese is a recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Soy sauce is a condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN MUSTARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brown mustard is a type of condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE SEA SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fine sea salt is a type of salt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a liquid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRUYERE CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Gruyere cheese is a type of cheese)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>MACARONI<|>Instant Pot is used to cook macaroni<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>CAULIFLOWER<|>Instant Pot is used to cook cauliflower<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>CHEESE<|>Instant Pot is used to melt cheese<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACARONI<|>CAULIFLOWER<|>Macaroni and cauliflower are ingredients in the recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACARONI<|>CHEESE<|>Macaroni and cheese are ingredients in the recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAULIFLOWER<|>CHEESE<|>Cauliflower and cheese are ingredients in the recipe<|>2"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
