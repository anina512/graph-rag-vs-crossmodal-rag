Whisk eggs, 1 Tbsp. mustard, and 2 Tbsp. water in another wide shallow bowl.\nSeason cutlets on both sides with 1/2 tsp. salt. Dip each in egg mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl, then in cornmeal mixture, shaking off excess.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering.

Here's a step-by-step approach to identify entities and relationships from the given text:\n\n### Step 1: Entity Identification\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll identify entities of the types \"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", and \"event\".\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor entity in doc.ents:\n    if entity.label_ in [\"ORG\", \"PERSON\", \"GPE\", \"EVENT\"]:\n        entities.append({\n            \"entity_name\": entity.text.capitalize(),\n            \"entity_type\": entity.label_,\n            \"entity_description\": entity.text\n        })\n\n# Format entities as required\nentities = [f\"('entity'<|>{entity['entity_name']}<|>{entity['entity_type']}<|>{entity['entity_description']}')\" for entity in entities]\n```\n\n### Step 2: Relationship Identification\n\nWe'll use the entities identified in the previous step to find relationships between them. We'll use a simple approach to identify relationships based on the context in which the entities appear.\n\n```python\n# Identify relationships\nrelationships = []\nfor i in range(len(entities)):\n    for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n        # Check if the entities are related\n        if entities[i][\"entity_name\"] in entities[j][\"entity_description\"] or entities[j][\"entity_name\"] in entities[i][\"entity_description\"]:\n            relationships.append({\n                \"source_entity\": entities[i][\"entity_name\"],\n                \"target_entity\": entities[j][\"entity_name\"],\n                \"relationship_description\": f\"The {entities[i]['entity_name']} is related to the {entities[j]['entity_name']}.\",\n                \"relationship_strength\": 1\n            })\n\n# Format relationships as required\nrelationships = [f\"('relationship'<|>{relationship['source_entity']}<|>{relationship['target_entity']}<|>{relationship['relationship_description']}<|>{relationship['relationship_strength']}')\" for relationship in relationships]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Entities and Relationships\n\nWe'll combine the entities and relationships into a single list, separated by the \"##\" delimiter.\n\n```python\n# Combine entities and relationships\noutput = entities + relationships\n```\n\n### Step"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
