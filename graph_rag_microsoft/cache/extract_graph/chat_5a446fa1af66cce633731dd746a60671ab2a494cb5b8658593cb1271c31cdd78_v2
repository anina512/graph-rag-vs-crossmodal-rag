Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and carefully remove the parchment-paper lining. Allow the cake to cool for 1 hour more before serving.\nNote: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime. The rinds of grapefruit and oro blanco are much thicker than lemons and oranges and they will take longer to bake. Lime and grapefruit also retain too much of the bitter quinine flavor and will make for an odd-tasting cake\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5a446fa1af66cce633731dd746a60671ab2a494cb5b8658593cb1271c31cdd78_v2"}
