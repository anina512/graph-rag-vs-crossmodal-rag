Heat oil in heavy large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add half of ribs and sauté until brown, turning occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer ribs to bowl. Repeat with remaining ribs.\nReduce heat to medium-low. Add onion, garlic, and shallots to pot. Cover and cook until soft, occasionally scraping up any browned bits, about 8 minutes. Mix in anchovy fillets; cook 1 minute. Add white wine and Pernod. Increase heat and boil mixture 3 minutes. Add diced tomatoes with juice, chicken broth, and chopped fresh tarragon; stir to blend. Add veal and any accumulated juices from bowl, arranging veal in single layer in pot. Bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until veal is tender, turning veal occasionally, about 1 3/4 hours.\nAdd peeled pearl onions and green olives to pot. Cover and simmer until pearl onions are tender, about 25 minutes longer. Do ahead Braised veal can be made 2 days ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to identify entities and relationships from the given text:\n\n### Step 1: Entity Identification\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll identify entities of the specified types (organization, person, geo, event) and extract the required information.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n        entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n        entity_type = ent.label_\n        entity_description = ent.text\n        entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n\n# Print the entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"({entity[0]}<|>{entity[1]}<|>{entity[2]}<|>{entity[3]})\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Relationship Identification\n\nWe'll use the entities identified in the previous step to find relationships between them. We'll use a simple approach to identify relationships based on the text.\n\n```python\n# Define a function to find relationships\ndef find_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            source_entity = entities[i][1]\n            target_entity = entities[j][1]\n            relationship_description = \"\"\n            for token in doc:\n                if token.text.lower() in [source_entity.lower(), target_entity.lower()]:\n                    relationship_description += token.text + \" \"\n            relationship_strength = 1  # Simple relationship strength\n            relationships.append((\"relationship\", source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    return relationships\n\n# Find relationships\nrelationships = find_relationships(entities)\n\n# Print the relationships\nfor relationship in relationships:\n    print(f\"({relationship[0]}<|>{relationship[1]}<|>{relationship[2]}<|>{relationship[3]}<|>{relationship[4]})\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Entities and Relationships\n\nWe'll combine the entities and relationships into a single list.\n\n```"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
