Raise the heat to moderate and bring the sauce to a boil, scraping the saucepan with a wooden spoon to remove any browned bits from the bottom. Add the ketchup, hot sauce, and bay leaves, then lower the heat to moderately low and simmer the sauce until it's thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but isn't as thick as ketchup, about 30 minutes. Taste the sauce and add more vinegar or hot sauce to taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove and discard the bay leaves. DO AHEAD: BBQ sauce can be made ahead and stored, in an airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 2 weeks. Warm the sauce gently on the stove before using.\nWhile the barbecue sauce is simmering, prepare your grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-high heat: If using a charcoal grill, open the vents on the bottom of the grill and light a large chimney starter full of charcoal (preferably hardwood). When the coals are covered with white-gray ash (about 20 to 30 minutes later), spread them out on the grill's bottom rack, leaving a space to one side that is equal to the size of the food to be grilled so that it can be moved there in the case of flare-ups. Test the heat of the charcoal by holding your hand 5 inches above the coals for about 3 seconds for medium-high heat. If the charcoal is too hot, continue to let it burn until it reaches medium-high.\nIf using a gas grill, preheat all burners on high, covered, for 10 minutes, then adjust the heat to medium-high.\nDepending on the size of your grill, place 1 or 2 slabs, bone side down, over the heat and brush the fat-covered side generously with barbecue sauce. Grill the ribs, covered, for 2 minutes. Flip the slab over, brush the bone side with sauce, and grill, covered, until the sauce on the fat-covered side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the slab over and continue grilling, covered, until the sauce on the bone side is caramelized and lightly charred, 1 minute. Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes. If necessary, repeat the grilling and glazing process with the second slab of ribs. Cut between the ribs and serve\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Worcestershire sauce is a type of condiment used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAY LEAVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bay leaves are a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KETCHUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ketchup is a type of condiment used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot sauce is a type of condiment used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARCOAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charcoal is a type of fuel used in grilling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grill is a type of cooking device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BURNERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Burners are a type of component used in gas grills)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ribs are a type of food used in grilling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPOON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spoon is a type of utensil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepper is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vinegar is a type of condiment used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person who is cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN<|>PERSON<|>John is a person who is cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE<|>GEO<|>Worcestershire is a county in England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>England is a country in the United Kingdom)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED KINGDOM<|>GEO<|>United Kingdom is a country in Europe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPE<|>GEO<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
