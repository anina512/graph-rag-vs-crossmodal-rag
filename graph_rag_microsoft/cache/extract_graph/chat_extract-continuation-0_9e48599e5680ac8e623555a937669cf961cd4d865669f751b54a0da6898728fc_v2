Wash beets, leaving some water on skins. Wrap individually in foil; place on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until beets are tender when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, using a sharp knife, cut all peel and white pith from all oranges; discard. Working over a medium bowl, cut between membranes of 2 blood oranges to release segments into bowl; squeeze juice from membranes into bowl and discard membranes. Slice remaining blood orange and Cara Cara orange crosswise into thin rounds. Place sliced oranges in bowl with the segments. Add lemon juice and lime juice.\nPeel cooled beets. Slice 2 beets crosswise into thin rounds. Cut remaining 2 beets into wedges. Strain citrus juices; reserve. Layer beets and oranges on plates, dividing evenly. Arrange fennel and onion over beets. Spoon reserved citrus juices over, then drizzle salad generously with oil. Season to taste with coarse sea salt and pepper. Let salad stand for 5 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Garnish salad with cilantro leaves.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BLOOD ORANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blood Orange is a type of citrus fruit used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beet is a type of root vegetable used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FENNEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fennel is a type of vegetable used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime is a type of citrus fruit used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange is a type of citrus fruit used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red onion is a type of vegetable used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cilantro is a type of herb used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHERVIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chervil is a type of herb used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN SEED OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pumpkin seed oil is a type of oil used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALNUT OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walnut oil is a type of oil used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLEUR DE SEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fleur de sel is a type of salt used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Maldon SEA SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maldon sea salt is a type of salt used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a type of spice used in the salad)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is the person who created the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOD"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
