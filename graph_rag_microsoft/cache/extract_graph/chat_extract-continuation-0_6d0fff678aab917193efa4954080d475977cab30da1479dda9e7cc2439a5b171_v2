Cook over medium heat until mixture thickens and begins to boil, stirring occasionally, 12 to 14 minutes. Continue to boil 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Transfer berry mixture to glass or ceramic dish; cool completely (mixture will thicken). DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; chill.\nPosition rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°F. Roll out 1 dough disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer crust to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish; trim dough overhang to 1 inch. Remove cinnamon sticks from filling; spoon into crust. Roll out second dough disk to 13x10- inch rectangle. Cut dough lengthwise into 3/4-inch-wide strips (11 to 12 strips).\nArrange half of dough strips across top of filling, spacing evenly apart. Form lattice by arranging remaining dough strips at right angle to first dough strips and weaving strips, if desired. Trim off excess dough from strips. Brush edges of bottom crust lightly with whipping cream. Press dough strip ends to adhere to bottom crust edges. Fold edges of bottom crust up over strips, pinching to seal. Crimp edges decoratively. Brush edges and lattice lightly with cream. Sprinkle lattice strips lightly with nutmeg. Place pie on rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling thickly, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Cool pie on rack. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.\nServe pie at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a recipe for a dessert pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that can be made ahead of time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that can be served at room temperature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires a pie crust and filling ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires baking in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires a lattice crust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires brushing with heavy whipping cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires sprinkling with nutmeg)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires a baking sheet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires a rack in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie that requires a preheated oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY AND WILD BLUEBERRY PIE<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry and Wild Blueberry Pie is a dessert pie"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
