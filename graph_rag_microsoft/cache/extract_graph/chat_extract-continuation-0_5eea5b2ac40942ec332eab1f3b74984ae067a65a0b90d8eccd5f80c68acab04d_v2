Place yogurt in sieve, cover with plastic wrap, and let drain in refrigerator at least 1 day and up to 2 days if you want it slightly thicker. Discard excess liquid. (Or skip this step entirely and use 1 1/2 cups store-bought labneh instead.)\nPrepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); lightly oil grate. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, gently stretch to about a 10x8\" oval. Grill over direct heat, turning and rotating as needed, until bread is stiff and both sides are lightly charred, about 3 minutes total. Move to indirect heat to keep warm while you grill remaining piece of dough.\nTransfer both flatbreads to a work surface and spread drained yogurt over. Top with trout, radishes, dill, and chives. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.\nYogurt can be drained 1 week ahead.
