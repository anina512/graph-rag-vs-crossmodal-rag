Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables just begin to caramelize, then add the reserved garlic and chiles, and cook for a few more minutes.\nTurn off the heat (so that the liquids won't evaporate immediately), and add the balsamic vinegar, then the wine. Turn the heat back up to medium-high, and reduce the wine by a quarter. Add the beef stock, and bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Pour the hot stock over the meat, scraping any vegetables that have fallen on the brisket back into the liquid. The stock mixture should almost cover the brisket. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid. Braise in the oven for 5 to 6 hours.\nTo check for doneness, carefully remove the lid and foil, watching out for the hot steam. Test the meat by inserting a paring knife into it; if the knife slides in easily, then the brisket is done.\nLet the brisket cool in its juices for 30 minutes. Carefully transfer it to a baking sheet, and chill completely.\nStrain the braising juices into a saucepan, pressing down on the vegetables with a ladle to extract all the liquid. Skim the fat from the braising juices, and chill.\nWhen you are ready to serve, preheat the oven to 400°F.\nCut the cold brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Lay the slices in two large roasting pans (or equivalent). Heat the braising juices, and pour some over the meat, just to cover. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the meat is hot and caramelized and crispy on top.\nPlace the slow-roasted Romano beans at the center of six large dinner plates, and arrange the brisket on top. Drizzle some of the braising juices over the meat. Dollop a generous tablespoon of the black olive aïoli over the meat, and pass the rest at the table.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_63a9550fdb5639138685f43535fdc75054f1484f7c4011d37925fd49bd71453d_v2"}
