Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify named entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Relationship extraction**: Identify relationships between entities in the text.\n5. **Entity and relationship formatting**: Format the extracted entities and relationships according to the required output format.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform these tasks:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"about a 7x5\\\" rectangle. Using your rolling pin, gently tap and press dough to compact and tidy up edges. Roll out dough, dusting dough and surface as needed, until 3 times longer than when you started. Fold dough over onto itself in thirds like a letter to make a square. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 12\\\" round. Wrap dough around your rolling pin and unfurl into a standard 9\\\"-diameter pie dish. Gently lift dough so it slumps down into edges of dish. Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350° and bake crust until edges are golden, 20–25 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping.

Identify all entities.
