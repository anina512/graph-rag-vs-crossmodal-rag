Add and stir butter, sugar, and salt until the sugar is dissolved.\nCombine water and yeast in a large bowl and let stand until the yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes.\nWhen the milk mixture has cooled to lukewarm, stir it into the yeast. Beat in egg, if desired.\nHave the flour ready. Stir in part of the flour, then knead in the rest, using only enough to form a dough that can be handled easily. Place in an oiled bowl. Brush the top with melted butter.\nCover and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk.\nRoll the dough out into a 30-inch-long log and cut into 1-inch pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and flatten into a 2-inch round. Dip the handle of a knife or wooden spoon in flour and use it to make a deep crease across the middle of each roll. Fold the rolls over on the crease and press the edges together lightly. Place about 2 inches apart in rows on greased baking sheets. Let rise in a warm place until light, about 35 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS<|>EVENT<|>Parker House Rolls is a recipe for a classic American dessert)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>YEAST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yeast is a microorganism used in baking to make dough rise)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Milk is a dairy product used in baking to add moisture and flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a dairy product used in baking to add flavor and moisture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a sweetener used in baking to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used in baking to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a liquid used in baking to help dissolve ingredients and create dough)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is a protein used in baking to add moisture and richness)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking to add structure and texture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARKER HOUSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parker House is a company that may have created the recipe for Parker House Rolls)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL PARKER<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Parker may have created the recipe for Parker House Rolls)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOSTON<|>GEO<|>Boston is a city where Parker House Rolls may have originated)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>YEAST<|>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS<|>Yeast is used in Parker House Rolls to make the dough rise<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MILK<|>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS<|>Milk is used in Parker House Rolls to add moisture and flavor<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>PARKER HOUSE ROLLS<|>Butter is used in Parker House Rolls to add flavor and"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
