1/2 tsp smoked paprika', '1/2-1 tsp chili powder', '1/2 tsp salt', 'Handful fresh cilantro', '12 crunchy taco shells', '1 cup guacamole', '1 cup salsa', 'Deep frying pan with a lid over medium heat']\n\nInstructions:\nTip the jackfruit into a sieve or colander to drain the excess water and pat the pieces down with a clean kitchen towel to dry them off | Cut into 1/4-inch strips and put to one side\nPeel and slice the onion and garlic very thinly | Warm the vegetable oil in the frying pan | Add the onion and garlic to the pan and stir with a wooden spoon until soft and translucent | Add the jackfruit, maple syrup, vegetable stock, and Tabasco sauce | Cut 1 of the limes in half and squeeze in the juice of one half, catching any seeds in your other hand | Stir until the jackfruit is well covered\nPut the lid on the pan, turn down the heat, and let it simmer for 7–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has been absorbed into the jackfruit | Take the lid off the pan and sprinkle in all the spices and the salt | Stir until the jackfruit pieces are well covered and taking on the color of the spices | Transfer the jackfruit pieces to a serving dish\nSlice the remaining limes into wedges and remove the leaves from the cilantro by running your thumb and forefinger from the top to the base of the stems (the leaves should easily come away), saving the stems for another recipe | Serve the taco shells, jackfruit, guacamole, salsa, lime wedges, and cilantro leaves on individual plates and let everyone build their own tacos\n######################\nOutput:",
