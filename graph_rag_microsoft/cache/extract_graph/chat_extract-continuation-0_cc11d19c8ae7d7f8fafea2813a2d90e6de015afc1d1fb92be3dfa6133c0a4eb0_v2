Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl, then whisk in beer until almost smooth (some small lumps are welcome—don't overwhisk or you'll deflate the batter). One by one, dredge the blossoms in batter, shaking off the excess; gently lay them in the oil, without crowding the pan. Cook, flipping once with a slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2-3 minutes total. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle with sea salt and devour while hot.\nFor an even lighter, crispier crust, fold 3 stiffly beaten egg whites into batter and proceed as above.\nStuffed blossoms are a favorite in Italy. To fill about 16, combine 1 cup ricotta, 1 tablespoon freshly chopped mint, and 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest in a bowl. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Using a spoon, fill each blossom with about 1 tablespoon ricotta mixture, then dip in batter and fry as above.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>FRIED ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>EVENT<|>Fried Zucchini Blossoms is a recipe for a dish that combines zucchini blossoms with a light batter and frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>EVENT<|>Zucchini blossoms are the main ingredient in Fried Zucchini Blossoms and are typically sold at farmers' markets and better supermarkets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Vegetable oil is used for frying in Fried Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>All-purpose flour is used to make the batter for Fried Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PILSNER BEER<|>EVENT<|>Pilsner beer is used to make the batter for Fried Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLUB SODA<|>EVENT<|>Club soda is used as a substitute for beer in Fried Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in Fried Zucchini Blossoms for seasoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICOTTA<|>EVENT<|>Ricotta is used as a filling in Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINT<|>EVENT<|>Mint is used as a flavoring in Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON ZEST<|>EVENT<|>Lemon zest is used as a flavoring in Stuffed Zucchini Blossoms)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIED ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>Fried Zucchini Blossoms is a dish that combines zucchini blossoms with a light batter and frying<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIED ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>Vegetable oil is used for frying in Fried Zucchini Blossoms<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRIED ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>All-purpose flour is used to make the batter for Fried Zucchini Blossoms<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
