Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and top with the cream. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (the bowl shouldn’t touch the water) and, using a metal spoon, stir until melted and smooth. Add the crushed pretzels, salt and bourbon and mix well to combine. Allow to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Refrigerate for 2–3 hours or until just set.\nWhile the mixture is cooling, make the bourbon sugar. Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F). Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Place the sugar and bourbon in a small bowl and mix to combine. Spread in an even layer on the tray and bake for 30 minutes or until golden and crisp. Allow to cool completely before crushing into fine crumbs.\nRoll 1-teaspoon portions of the truffle mixture into balls and press in the bourbon sugar to coat. Place the truffles on the tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOURBON SUGAR AND PRETZEL TRUFFLES<|>EVENT<|>Bourbon Sugar and Pretzel Truffles is a recipe"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
