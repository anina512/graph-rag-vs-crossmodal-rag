Gradually whisk in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nCook sweet potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just barely tender, about 6 minutes. Drain; run under cold water to cool. Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.\nPreheat barbecue (high heat). Brush potato wedges with canola oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill potatoes until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer potatoes to work surface. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Place potatoes, poblanos, green onions, and parsley in large bowl. Drizzle dressing over; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve warm or at room temperature.
