Season chicken with salt and pepper and cook, turning occasionally, until skin is golden brown and crisp, 8–10 minutes. Transfer to a plate (it will not be cooked through).\nAdd onions to same skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic, lemongrass (if using), vadouvan, and cayenne and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add broth, coconut milk, lime juice, and 1/2 cup cilantro, then return chicken to skillet and gently push down into liquid. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken is tender and cooked through and sauce is thickened, 40–45 minutes. Be sure to turn chicken a couple of times while it’s cooking so all sides get exposed to the curry sauce.\nJust before chicken is done, cook noodles according to package directions. Rinse noodles under warm water, then toss in a large bowl with a little bit of the curry sauce. This will help to prevent them from sticking.\nDivide noodles among shallow bowls. Place drumsticks on top and ladle curry sauce over. Top with crispy shallots and remaining 1/2 cup cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CURRIED CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS<|>EVENT<|>Curried Chicken Drumsticks is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS<|>EVENT<|>Chicken drumsticks are a key ingredient in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GHEE<|>EVENT<|>Ghee is used as a cooking oil in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VIRGIN COCONUT OIL<|>EVENT<|>Virgin coconut oil is used as a cooking oil in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Chicken is a key ingredient in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONIONS<|>EVENT<|>Onions are a key ingredient in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMONGRASS<|>EVENT<|>Lemongrass is an optional ingredient in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VADOUVAN<|>EVENT<|>Vadouvan is a spice used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CAYENNE PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Cayenne pepper is a spice used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN BROTH<|>EVENT<|>Chicken broth is a liquid used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>COCONUT MILK<|>EVENT<|>Coconut milk is a liquid used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIME JUICE<|>EVENT<|>Lime juice is a liquid used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>EVENT<|>Cilantro is a herb used in the Curried Chicken Drumsticks recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RICE NOODLES<|>EVENT<|>Rice noodles are"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
