Line a tray with wax paper and lightly grease paper.\nBoil wine in a small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat.\nBring sugar and water to a boil in a 2 1/2-to 3-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally so caramel colors evenly, until dark amber. Add reduced wine (mixture will bubble up and steam) and swirl pan. Add cream and simmer, stirring, until incorporated, then continue to simmer until thermometer registers 238°F. Remove from heat and cool to 200°F.\nHolding apples by the sticks, dip them in caramel and swirl to coat, letting excess drip off, then hold apples up (stick end down) for about 15 seconds to allow more caramel to set on apples. Put caramel apples, stick side up, on greased wax paper and let stand until caramel firms up, about 30 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RED WINE CARAMEL APPLES<|>EVENT<|>Red Wine Caramel Apples is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCGINTOSH APPLES<|>GEO<|>McIntosh apples are a type of apple used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red wine is a type of wine used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a type of dairy product used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAX PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wax paper is a type of paper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDY THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Candy thermometer is a type of kitchen tool used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASTRY BRUSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pastry brush is a type of kitchen tool used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED WINE CARAMEL APPLES<|>MCGINTOSH APPLES<|>Red Wine Caramel Apples uses McIntosh apples as an ingredient<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED WINE CARAMEL APPLES<|>RED WINE<|>Red Wine Caramel Apples uses red wine as an ingredient<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED WINE CARAMEL APPLES<|>SUGAR<|>Red Wine Caramel Apples uses sugar as an ingredient<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RED WINE CARAMEL APPLES<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>Red Wine Caramel App"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
