Roll out second dough disk between sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 12- to 13-inch round; transfer dough to baking sheet. Refrigerate both crusts while preparing filling.\nPosition rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Combine all apple wedges, 1/3 cup sugar, raisins, quick-cooking tapioca, grated lemon peel, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg in large bowl; toss to blend. Let stand at room temperature until some juices form, tossing occasionally, about 15 minutes.\nPlace crust-lined pie dish on rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs over bottom of crust. Transfer apple filling to crust, mounding filling slightly in center. Dot filling with butter cubes. Brush crust edges lightly with water. Remove top parchment sheet from second dough round. Invert dough round atop filling; remove second parchment sheet. Trim dough overhang on both crusts to 1/2 inch. Press crust edges together, then fold under. Using tines of fork, press on crust edge around rim of dish to seal decoratively. Using small sharp knife, cut six 1-inch slits in top crust, then cut out 1/2-inch circle from center of top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush top crust lightly with milk, then sprinkle with raw sugar.\nBake pie 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and continue to bake pie until crust is golden, apples are tender when pierced, and juices are bubbling thickly through slits in crust, covering crust edges with foil collar if crust is browning too quickly, about 1 hour longer. Transfer pie to rack and cool to lukewarm or room temperature. Cut pie into wedges.\nAlso called turbinado or demerara sugar; available at most supermarkets and at natural foods stores.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROLL OUT<|>EVENT<|>Roll out second dough disk between sheets of parchment paper or waxed paper to 12- to 13-inch round)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE<|>EVENT<|>Pie is a baked dish made with a pastry crust and a filling, typically made with fruit or cream)\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>EVENT<|>Apples are a type of fruit that are often used in pies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRAHAM CRACKER<|>EVENT<|>Graham crackers are a type of cracker that are often used as a crust for pies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Lemons are a type of citrus fruit that are often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NUTMEG<|>EVENT<|>Nutmeg is a type of spice that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TAPIOTA<|>EVENT<|>Tapiota is a type of starch that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE CRUST<|>EVENT<|>Pie crust is a type of pastry crust that is often used in pies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>EVENT<|>Baking sheet is a type of baking surface that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE DISH<|>EVENT<|>Pie dish is a type of dish that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>EVENT<|>Room temperature is a type of temperature that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LUKewarm<|>EVENT<|>Lukewarm is a type of temperature that is often used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUPERMARKET<|>EVENT<|>Supermarket is a type of store that sells food and other products)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NATURAL FOODS STORE<|>EVENT<|>Natural foods store is a type of store that sells natural and organic products)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TURBINADO SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Turbinado sugar is a type of sugar that is often"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
