Set dough aside to rest for 3 minutes. Add the oil and work it in with your hands, adding cornmeal or water to return the dough to the proper consistency.\n4 Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Shape each into a 4-inch diameter disk, about 1 inch thick. Transfer to a baking sheet.\n5 Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a large nonstick skillet or griddle and heat over medium heat.\n6 In batches, place the arepas in the skillet. Cook until the underside is a splotchy golden brown, about 4 minutes. Turn and brown the other side. Return arepas to the baking sheet.\n7 When all of the arepas are browned, transfer them directly to the oven rack (without the baking sheet). Bake until the surfaces of the arepas have formed a taut skin-if you rap your fingers on one, it will feel and sound like a drum. Return arepas to the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Split each arepa in half and fill with the chicken mixture. Serve warm.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CORNMEAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornmeal is a type of flour used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil is a type of liquid used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of appliance used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Skillet is a type of cooking vessel used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Griddle is a type of cooking surface used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking sheet is a type of cooking surface used in baking arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken mixture is a type of filling used in arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AREPA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arepas are a type of flatbread used in Latin American cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LATIN AMERICAN CUISINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Latin American cuisine is a type of cuisine that includes arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUAN<|>PERSON<|>Juan is a person who bakes arepas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUAN'S KITCHEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Juan's kitchen is a place where arepas are baked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AREPA BAKING<|>EVENT<|>Arepas are baked in a skillet or oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN FILLING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken filling is a type of filling used in arepas)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CORNMEAL<|>OIL<|>Cornmeal and oil are used together in baking arepas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVEN<|>SKILLET<|>Oven and skillet are used together in baking arepas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SKILLET<|>GRIDDLE<|>Skillet and griddle are used together in baking arepas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
