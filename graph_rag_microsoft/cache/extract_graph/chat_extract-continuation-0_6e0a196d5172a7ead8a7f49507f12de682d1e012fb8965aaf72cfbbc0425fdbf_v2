Season lightly to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.\nRewarm mushrooms in large skillet over medium-high heat until heated through. Add broth and simmer 1 minute. Stir in crème fraîche and half of parsley. Season mushroom ragout to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 300°F. Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add polenta squares to skillet and cook until browned, about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven while cooking remaining polenta squares.\nArrange 2 polenta squares on each plate. Top each with warm mushroom ragout; sprinkle with grated Comté cheese and remaining parsley and serve.\nComté is a semi-firm, Gruyère-style cow's-milk cheese made primarily in France's Franche-Comté region. It adds great flavor to this recipe and would also be delicious on a cheese platter. Comté is available at some supermarkets, cheese shops, and specialty foods stores.\n*Polenta can be found at some supermarkets, as well as at natural foods stores and Italian markets. If polenta is unavailable, substitute an equal amount of regular yellow cornmeal and cook it about half as long.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COMTÉ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Comté is a semi-firm, Gruyère-style cow's-milk cheese made primarily in France's Franche-Comté region)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>Country where Comté cheese is primarily made)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRANCHE-COMTÉ<|>GEO<|>Region in France where Comté cheese is primarily made)\n## (\"entity\"<|>POLENTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Polenta is a type of cornmeal-based dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUPERMARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some supermarkets sell Comté cheese and polenta)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHEESE SHOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some cheese shops sell Comté cheese)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPECIALTY FOODS STORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some specialty foods stores sell Comté cheese)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some Italian markets sell polenta)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NATURAL FOODS STORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some natural foods stores sell polenta)\n## (\"entity\"<|>REGULAR YELLOW CORNMEAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Regular yellow cornmeal can be used as a substitute for polenta)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>COMTÉ<|>FRANCE<|>Comté cheese is primarily made in France<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>COMTÉ<|>FRANCHE-COMTÉ<|>Comté cheese is primarily made in Franche-Comté region<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>SUPERMARKET<|>Some supermarkets sell polenta<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>CHEESE SHOP<|>Some cheese shops sell polenta<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>SPECIALTY FOODS STORE<|>Some specialty foods stores sell polenta<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>ITALIAN MARKET<|>Some Italian markets sell polenta<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>NATURAL FOODS"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
