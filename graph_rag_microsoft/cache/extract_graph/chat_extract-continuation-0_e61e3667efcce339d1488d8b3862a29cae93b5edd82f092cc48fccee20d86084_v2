Add butter; pulse until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces. Whisk egg and milk in a small bowl to blend; add to processor and pulse until moist clumps form. Gather dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap; chill at least 1 1/2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.\nDissolve cornstarch in 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl; set aside. Combine rhubarb, raspberries, and sugar in a large heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until sugar dissolves and juices are released, about 4 minutes. Stir in cornstarch mixture and bring to a boil (rhubarb will not be tender and slices will still be intact). Transfer to a bowl. Chill until cool, about 30 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 400°F Roll out dough on floured parchment paper to 12\" round; brush with beaten egg. Mound filling in center of crust; gently spread out, leaving 1 1/2\" border. Gently fold edges of dough over filling, pleating as needed. Brush border with egg; sprinkle with raw sugar. Slide parchment with crostata onto a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 45 minutes. Let crostata cool on baking sheet on a rack. Transfer crostata to a platter, cut into wedges, and serve with whipped cream or ice cream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB AND RASPBERRY CROSTATA<|>EVENT<|>Rhubarb and Raspberry Crostata is a dessert recipe that combines rhubarb and raspberries with a pastry crust)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB<|>GEO<|>Rhubarb is a type of vegetable often used in desserts)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRIES<|>GEO<|>Raspberries are a type of fruit often used in desserts)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RHUBARB AND RASPBERRY CROSTATA<|>EVENT<|>Rhubarb and Raspberry Crostata is a dessert recipe that combines rhubarb and raspberries with a pastry crust)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>UNBLEACHED ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unbleached all-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole wheat flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole milk is a type of milk used in baking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornstarch is a type of thickening agent used in cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RAW SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Raw sugar is a type of sugar used in cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SWEETENED WHIPPED CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sweetened whipped cream is a type of topping used in desserts)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
