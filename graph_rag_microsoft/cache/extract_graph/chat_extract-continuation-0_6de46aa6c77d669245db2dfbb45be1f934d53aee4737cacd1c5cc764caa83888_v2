Repeat sifting into another bowl (flour will have been sifted 3 times total).\nBeat together butter (2 sticks) and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes in a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment or 6 to 8 minutes with a handheld mixer. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add half of flour, then all of cream, then remaining flour, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down side of bowl, then beat at medium-high speed 5 minutes. Batter will become creamier and satiny.\nSpoon batter into pan and rap pan against work surface once or twice to eliminate air bubbles. Place pan in (cold) oven and turn oven temperature to 350°F. Bake until golden and a wooden pick or skewer inserted in middle of cake comes out with a few crumbs adhering, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Cool cake in pan on a rack 30 minutes. Run a thin knife around inner and outer edges of cake, then invert rack over pan and invert cake onto rack to cool completely.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>ELVIS PRESLEY<|>PERSON<|>Elvis Presley is the person who presumably likes the pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POUND CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Pound cake is a type of cake that Elvis Presley likes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Cake flour is a type of flour used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is a type of ingredient used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla is a type of flavoring used to make pound cake)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELVIS PRESLEY<|>POUND CAKE<|>Elvis Presley likes the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>POUND CAKE<|>Cake flour is used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>POUND CAKE<|>Unsalted butter is used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUGAR<|>POUND CAKE<|>Sugar is used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>POUND CAKE<|>Eggs are used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>POUND CAKE<|>Heavy cream is used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA<|>POUND CAKE<|>Vanilla is used to make the pound cake<|>1)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
