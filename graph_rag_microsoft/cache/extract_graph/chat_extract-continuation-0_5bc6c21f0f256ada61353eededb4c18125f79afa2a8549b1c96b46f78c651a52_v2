Place salmon, skin side down, on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and coat flesh lightly with oil. Bake until just cooked through (flesh will flake easily but still be slightly firm in the very center), 20–25 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place daikon or whatever vegetables you’re using in a small bowl and season with salt. Massage gently with your hands to soften. Drain off any liquid that forms. Add vinegar and toss to coat. Cover and chill until ready to use (this will help vegetables stay firm).\nWhisk hot sauce, lime juice, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Season vinaigrette with salt.\nDivide rice among bowls. Break up salmon into pieces and arrange on top. Drizzle vinaigrette over. Add cilantro and chives to vegetables; spoon over salmon.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SALMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmon is a type of fish used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot sauce is a condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a cooking oil used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAIKON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Daikon is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED RADISHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red radishes are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUCUMBERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cucumbers are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Carrots are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOLULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cholula is a brand of hot sauce used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIME JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime juice is a citrus juice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKED RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cooked rice is a side dish used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cilantro is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIVES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chives are a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLETS<|>PERSON<|>Salmon fillets are a type of fish used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>PERSON<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEASONED RICE VINEGAR<|>PERSON<|>Seasoned rice vinegar is a type of vinegar used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH LIME JUICE<|>PERSON<|>Fresh lime juice is a citrus juice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
