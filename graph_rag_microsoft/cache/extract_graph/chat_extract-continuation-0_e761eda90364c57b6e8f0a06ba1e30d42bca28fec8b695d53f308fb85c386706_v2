Dijon mustard', '1/2 tsp. agave nectar', '2 garlic cloves', '1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more', '1/2 cup basil leaves', '1/4 cup parsley leaves with tender stems', '12 cups baby greens (such as kale, spinach, and/or arugula)', '2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved', '4 Persian cucumbers, cut into 1\" pieces (about 2 cups)', '2 avocado, cut into 3/4\" pieces', '1 1/3 cups crumbled feta']\n\nInstructions:\nBring a small pot of water to a boil. Add quinoa, return to a boil, and cook until tender, 15–20 minutes. Drain, return quinoa to warm pot, and fluff with a fork to release some of the steam. Season with salt; cover to keep warm until ready to serve.\nMeanwhile, prepare a grill for medium-high heat. (Or heat a cast-iron grill pan or medium skillet over medium-high.) Rub chicken on all sides with oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill (or sear) chicken, turning halfway through, until just cooked through, 12–15 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes, then cut into 1/2\" pieces.\nPurée mayonnaise, lime juice, matcha, mustard, agave, garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt in a food processor until smooth. Add basil and parsley and pulse until incorporated.\nToss quinoa, chicken, greens, tomatoes, and cucumbers in a large bowl to combine. Add 1/2 cup dressing and toss to coat; season with salt.\nDivide salad among bowls and top with avocado and feta.

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n\n2. **Entity Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to extract relationships.\n\n4. **Relationship Scoring**: Use a machine learning model to score the strength of each relationship.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text and entity types\ntext = \"Grilled Chicken and Quinoa with Matcha Dressing\"\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Tokenize the text\ntokens = word_tokenize(text)\n\n# Remove stopwords and lemmatize the tokens\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\nlemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\nfiltered_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]\n\n# Identify entities using spaCy\ndoc = nlp(text)\nentities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]\n\n# Classify entities into specified types\nclassified_entities = []\nfor ent, label in entities:\n    if label in entity_types:\n        classified_entities.append((ent, label))\n\n# Extract relationships between entities\nrelationships = []\nfor ent1, label1 in classified_entities:\n    for ent2, label2 in classified_entities:\n        if ent1 != ent2:\n            relationships.append((ent1, ent2"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
