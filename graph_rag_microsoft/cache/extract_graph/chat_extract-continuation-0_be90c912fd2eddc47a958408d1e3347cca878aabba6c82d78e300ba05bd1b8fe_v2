Cover, reduce heat to very low, and gently simmer 25 minutes to allow aromatics to infuse and flavor the water. Strain dashi through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl; discard solids. Wipe out saucepan and pour dashi back in. Return to a simmer.\nMix miso and 1 Tbsp. dashi in a small bowl, then stir into dashi in pan along with soy sauce; season with salt. Keep dashi hot if using right away.\nDo Ahead: Dashi can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool, then transfer to an airtight container and chill.\nHeat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Cook mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, finely grate garlic over mushrooms, and mix well (garlic will cook in residual heat of mushrooms). Season with salt.\nDrop noodles into very hot dashi.
