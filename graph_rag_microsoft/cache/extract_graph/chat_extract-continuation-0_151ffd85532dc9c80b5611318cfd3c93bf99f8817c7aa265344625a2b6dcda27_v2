(If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. When Charcoal turns grayish white (about 15 minutes from lighting), hold your hand 5 inches above grill rack to determine heat for charcoal as follows: Hot: When you can hold your hand there for 1 to 2 seconds; Medium-hot: 3 to 4 seconds; Low: 5 to 6 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then, if necessary, reduce to heat specified in recipe.)\nWhile coals are lighting, heat a dry small heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over moderately low heat until hot, then toast coriander and cumin seeds, shaking skillet frequently, until a shade darker, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer seeds to mortar or grinder and cool completely, about 3 minutes, then finely grind.\nTransfer ground-spice mixture to a large bowl, then mash into softened butter along with parsley, red pepper flakes (to taste), and garlic until combined well.\nToss mushrooms with oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl, then grill on lightly oiled grill rack, covered only if using a gas grill, turning over occasionally, until lightly browned and tender, 12 to 14 minutes total. Quarter mushrooms while still hot, then toss with butter mixture and salt and pepper to taste.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GRILLED SPICED WHITE MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Spiced White Mushrooms is a recipe for cooking mushrooms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE MUSHROOMS<|>PERSON<|>White mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORIANDER SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>Coriander seeds are a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>Cumin seeds are a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>PERSON<|>Butter is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Parsley is a herb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED PEPPER FLAKES<|>PERSON<|>Red pepper flakes are a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Olive oil is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>Black pepper is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORTAR AND PESTLE<|>PERSON<|>Mortar and pestle is a tool used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC COFFEE/SPICE GRINDER<|>PERSON<|>Electric coffee/spice grinder is a tool used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARCOAL GRILL<|>PERSON<|>Charcoal grill is a type of grill used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAS GRILL<|>PERSON<|>Gas grill is a type of grill used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITE MUSHROOMS<|>CORIANDER SEEDS<|>White mushrooms are used in a recipe that includes coriander seeds<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITE MUSHROOMS<|>CUMIN SEEDS<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
