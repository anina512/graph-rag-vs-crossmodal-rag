To make the tostaditas: Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut 4 rounds from each tortilla. Pour 1/2 inch oil into a large, heavy skillet and heat over high heat until the oil is shimmering. Line a baking sheet with a double thickness of paper towels. Working in batches, add the tortillas to the oil and fry until golden brown, about 1 minute. Using a wire-mesh skimmer, transfer the tostaditas to the paper towels.\n2. To braise the pork: Bring 8 cups water to boil in a large casserole or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the pork, onion, garlic, and salt and return to the boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, until the pork is fork-tender, about 2 hours. Drain in a colander, discarding the onion and garlic, and let cool slightly. Transfer the pork to a chopping board and shred with 2 forks.\n3. To make the sauce: Cook the chorizo in a medium nonstick skillet over low heat, stirring often and crumbling it with a wooden spoon until it turns dark red and some of the oil is released, about 15 minutes. Drain in a fine-meshed sieve to remove the excess oil, and transfer to a bowl.\n4. Add the canola oil to the pan and heat over medium heat. Add the onion and cook\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text.
