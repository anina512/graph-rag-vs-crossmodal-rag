Cook chorizo and mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until chorizo is beginning to brown and mushrooms release their juices and then evaporate, about 10 minutes. Stir in kale, sauce, and oregano; season with salt. Cover and cook until kale is wilted, about 2 minutes. Toss to combine, then remove from heat and let cool.\nLine 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment. Cut dough into 8 equal portions (each should weigh 4 oz.) and roll into balls. Working one at a time, roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 7 1/2–8\"-diameter circle. Transfer 1/2 cup filling and 1/2 cup cheese to center of circle. Using a pastry brush or your finger, brush water around edges of circle, then fold dough in half over filling to create a half moon. Using a fork, press edges to seal. Transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, filling, and cheese.\nWhisk egg and milk in a small bowl. Brush tops of pizza pockets with egg wash.\nIf baking immediately, preheat oven to 350°F. If freezing to bake later, freeze on baking sheets 1 hour, then transfer to resealable plastic bags and freeze up to 3 months.\nBake pizza pockets on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets until tops are golden brown, about 30 minutes for fresh and about 40 minutes for frozen.\nFilling can be made 1 day ahead; transfer to an airtight container and chill. Pockets can be assembled 3 months ahead; keep frozen.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e6388196465d4d8b90191e909274cbcfbb1eacb1ef22fb54e07d9a846f7839c7_v2"}
