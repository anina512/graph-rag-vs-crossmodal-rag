When the oil is hot, place one cruller at a time in the oil, paper side up. Remove the paper with tongs. Fry on each side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel for at least 1 minute. Once cool to the touch, the crullers can be glazed.\nCrullers also bake very well, although they will have slightly firmer crusts than the fried versions. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pipe the crullers onto it, at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350°F and bake for another 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, open the oven door slightly and let the crullers sit in the cooling oven for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove, dip in glaze, and cool on a rack until the glaze has set.\nBeignets, the classic New Orleans fried dough treats, use this same batter and are even easier to prepare. Simply drop rounded teaspoonfuls of the batter into the oil. As the dough puffs, the beignets will turn themselves over—but keep an eye on them and flip any that need a little help.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>NEW ORLEANS<|>GEO<|>New Orleans is a city in the United States where beignets are a classic treat)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRULLERS<|>EVENT<|>Crullers are a type of fried dough pastry that can be glazed)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BEIGNETS<|>EVENT<|>Beignets are a type of fried dough pastry that is a classic treat in New Orleans)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>EVENT<|>Oil is used to fry crullers and beignets)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>EVENT<|>A baking sheet is used to bake crullers)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>An oven is used to bake crullers)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GLAZE<|>EVENT<|>A glaze is used to top crullers and beignets)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>NEW ORLEANS<|>BEIGNETS<|>Beignets are a classic treat in New Orleans<|>9)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRULLERS<|>BEIGNETS<|>Crullers and beignets are similar types of fried dough pastries<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRULLERS<|>GLAZE<|>Crullers can be glazed<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BEIGNETS<|>GLAZE<|>Beignets can be glazed<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OIL<|>CRULLERS<|>Oil is used to fry crullers<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OIL<|>BEIGNETS<|>Oil is used to fry beignets<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>CRULLERS<|>A baking sheet is used to bake crullers<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OVEN<|>CRULLERS<|>An oven is used to bake crullers<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GLAZE<|>CRULLERS<|>A glaze is used to top crullers<|>2)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GLAZE<|>BE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
