Add the chocolate chips and mix until just combined.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nScoop out portions of dough the size of golf balls, roll them between your palms loosely, and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet (you’ll need to bake the cookies in several batches). Bake for 14 minutes, or until the cookies are set around the edges. Halfway through baking, remove the pan from the oven and drop it onto a heat-safe flat surface, such as the open oven door (this deflates the cookies, creating a deliciously chewy center and crisp edges—in other words . . . perfect!). Immediately return the cookies to the oven, rotating the pan 180 degrees, and complete baking, until the center resists light pressure but is still somewhat soft.\nLet the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat to make the rest of the cookies.\nTo store extra dough and make future cookie baking a breeze, roll out balls and freeze them on a cookie sheet. Once they’re set, transfer them to a resealable freezer bag or airtight container and keep them frozen for up to 3 months. Let the dough balls sit out at room temperature\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHEWY COCONUT–CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Chewy Coconut–Chocolate Chip Cookies is a recipe for baking cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole wheat flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUICK-COOKING ROLLED OATS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Quick-cooking rolled oats are a type of oats used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSWEETENED SHREDDED COCONUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsweetened shredded coconut is a type of coconut used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda is a type of baking powder used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PACKED LIGHT BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Packed light brown sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Granulated sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pure vanilla extract is a type of extract used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large egg is a type of egg used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Semisweet chocolate chips are a type of chocolate used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stand mixer is a type of mixer used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PADDLE ATTACHMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paddle attachment is a type of attachment used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>GEO<|>Room temperature is a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
