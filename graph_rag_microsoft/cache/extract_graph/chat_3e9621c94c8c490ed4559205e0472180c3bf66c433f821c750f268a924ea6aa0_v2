Use a mortar and pestle to pound the chilies, ginger, garlic, and parsley with the salt to a coarse paste, pounding each ingredient thoroughly before adding the next. Add the olive oil, pounding again to form a pretty smooth paste.\n2. Rub the goat shoulder with the chili paste and refrigerate, covered, for 24 hours.\n1. Preheat a smoker (see Headnote above).\n2. Place the goat shoulder in the smoker (reserving any leftover marinade) and let it ride for about 3 hours. Keep an eye on the temperature, stoke your fire, and drink a Scotch. Occasionally baste the goat with the leftover marinade. After 3 hours, periodically jiggle the leg. When it gives you the sense that if you pulled just a bit harder you could tear it from the joint, it's ready, but it'll probably take another 3 to 4 hours. Serve it straight away on a platter and tear into with your hands.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_3e9621c94c8c490ed4559205e0472180c3bf66c433f821c750f268a924ea6aa0_v2"}
