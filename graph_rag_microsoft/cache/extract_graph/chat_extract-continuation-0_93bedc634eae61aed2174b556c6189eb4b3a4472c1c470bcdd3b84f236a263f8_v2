Toss frozen berries and cornstarch in large bowl. Let stand until cornstarch dissolves, tossing occasionally, about 20 minutes. Divide berry mixture among six 4 1/2-inch-diameter crème brûlée dishes with 1-inch-high sides. Toss brown sugar, flour, oats, nuts, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Add chilled butter; using fingertips, blend butter into mixture until coarse crumbs form. Divide oat mixture among dishes, sprinkling evenly over berry mixture.\nPlace dishes on rimmed baking sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue baking until crisp topping is golden brown and fruit filling is bubbling at edges, about 30 minutes longer. Cool crisps at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature topped with scoop of vanilla ice cream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MIXED-BERRY OATMEAL CRISPS<|>EVENT<|>Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXED BERRIES<|>EVENT<|>Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps is a dessert recipe that uses mixed berries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>EVENT<|>Cornstarch is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to thicken the berry mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN BROWN SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Golden brown sugar is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add sweetness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNBLEACHED ALL PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Unbleached all-purpose flour is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLD-FASHIONED OATS<|>EVENT<|>Old-fashioned oats are used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINELY CHOPPED WALNUTS OR PECANS<|>EVENT<|>Finely chopped walnuts or pecans are used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add crunch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND CINNAMON<|>EVENT<|>Ground cinnamon is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add richness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla ice cream is used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to add creaminess)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME BRÛLÉE DISHES<|>EVENT<|>Crème brûlée dishes are used in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe to hold the dessert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MIXED BERRIES<|>CORNSTARCH<|>Mixed berries and cornstarch are used together in the Mixed-Berry Oatmeal Crisps recipe<|>8"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
