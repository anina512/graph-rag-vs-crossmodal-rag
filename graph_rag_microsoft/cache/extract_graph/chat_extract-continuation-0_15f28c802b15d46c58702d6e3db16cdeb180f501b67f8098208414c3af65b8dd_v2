Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes. (If yeast does not activate, start over with new yeast.)\nStir together salt and remaining flour in a large bowl, then stir in egg and yeast mixture to form a dough.\nTurn out dough onto a well-floured surface and turn to coat with flour, then knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Form into a ball and dust with flour. Let dough rest in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap, punching down with a wet fist every hour, at least 2 hours and up to 3.\nPreheat oven to 500°F with rack in middle.\nTurn out dough onto floured pizza pan, turning to coat, then flatten with your fingers into a 7-inch disk.\nToss together cheeses and press into a compact 3-inch ball with your hands. Place ball in middle of dough, then gather dough up around ball of cheese, squeezing excess dough into a topknot. Press down on topknot with a damp fist to press cheese out from center. Continue to flatten dough and distribute cheese evenly, pressing outward from center, until dough is an 11-inch disk.\nCut a 6-inch X through top of dough to expose cheese. Bake until pale golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Brush surface of dough with butter and bake until golden and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes more.\nServe cut into wedges.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Georgian Cheese Bread is a recipe for a type of bread that combines cheese and other ingredients)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>YEAST<|>PERSON<|>Yeast is a microorganism used in baking to help dough rise)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HAVARTI CHEESE<|>PERSON<|>Havarti cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>PERSON<|>Mozzarella cheese is a type of cheese used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>PERSON<|>Egg is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>PERSON<|>Flour is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>PERSON<|>Water is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>PERSON<|>Butter is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GEORGIA<|>GEO<|>Georgia is a country where the bread may have originated)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>GEO<|>Georgian Cheese Bread is a type of bread that may have originated in Georgia)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>YEAST<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>Yeast is used in the recipe for Georgian Cheese Bread<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>HAVARTI CHEESE<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>Havarti cheese is an ingredient in the recipe for Georgian Cheese Bread<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>Mozzarella cheese is an ingredient in the recipe for Georgian Cheese Bread<|>8)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>EGG<|>GEORGIAN CHEESE BREAD<|>Egg is an ingredient in the recipe for Georgian Cheese Bread"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
