Add 1/4 cup rosemary leaves and lemon peel. Pound 1 minute. Stir 1/4 cup oil, lemon juice, and 2 teaspoons pepper into rosemary paste.\nPlace lamb, fat side up, on work surface. Cut shallow slits in fat about 1/2 inch apart. Spread 5 tablespoons rosemary paste over lamb, working into slits. Turn lamb over; repeat, cutting slits and spreading with remaining paste. Wrap lamb in plastic. Place in roasting pan; chill overnight.\nPreheat oven to 425°F. Remove lamb from pan; brush pan with oil. Remove plastic wrap from lamb; return to roasting pan, fat side up.
