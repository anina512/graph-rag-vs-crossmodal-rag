Place dough in a large buttered bowl and cover. Let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, 55–65 minutes.\nUncover dough and punch down several times to deflate. Line a 13x9\" baking dish with plastic wrap, leaving generous overhang on all sides. Place dough in pan and press into an even layer, working all the way to the sides of the pan. Fold plastic up and over dough, eliminating air pockets between dough and plastic. Chill dough in freezer until firm to the touch, 20–30 minutes.\nMix granulated sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Lightly brush tube pan with butter. Sprinkle with sanding sugar, tapping out excess; set aside. Remove dough from freezer and peel back plastic. Brush entire surface with melted butter and sprinkle generously with some cinnamon sugar. Shake excess sugar back into bowl, then invert baking pan and turn out dough onto work surface sugar side down. Remove plastic; discard. Brush other side of dough with butter and sprinkle with more cinnamon sugar. Use a pizza cutter or a chef’s knife to cut dough into a 12x6 grid.\nWorking relatively quickly so dough doesn’t become too soft, separate pieces and, working one at a time, roll lightly between your palms into balls, dusting with more cinnamon sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Place in prepared tube pan as you go. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until pieces have swelled to nearly doubled in size, 40–50 minutes. Preheat oven to 350° a little before monkey bread is ready to bake.\nRemove plastic from pan and bake monkey bread until golden brown, 25–35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then use a small offset spatula to loosen monkey bread from sides of pan. Pull bottom out from pan and use spatula to loosen bread from bottom. Slide bread back into pan; invert onto a plate and remove pan. Place a wire rack over bread and invert right side up onto rack. If using a Bundt pan, just invert directly onto wire rack. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.\nPour about 1/2 cup caramel sauce over monkey bread if desired. Serve with more sauce alongside for dipping.\nDough can be made 1 day ahead.
