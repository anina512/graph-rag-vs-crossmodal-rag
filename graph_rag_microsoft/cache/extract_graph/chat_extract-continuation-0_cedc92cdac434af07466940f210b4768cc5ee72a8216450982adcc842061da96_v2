Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and weights and bake until the top looks almost dry, another 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.\nWhile the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the squash with 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the nutmeg. Spread in an even layer and bake until the squash begins to brown around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.\nIn a large sauté pan over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the garlic. When the garlic starts to sizzle a bit and becomes fragrant, add the Swiss chard, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt. Sauté until the chard is wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside.\nPeel and halve the onion and thinly slice. In the same pan you used for the chard, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and stir every so often until caramelized, about 20 minutes. When the onions are a nice light brown color, add the balsamic vinegar, stir, and turn off the heat. The onions will absorb the vinegar as they cool a bit.\nSqueeze out any excess water from the Swiss chard and return to the bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until blended well, then add to the chard. To the bowl with the chard, add three-fourths of the squash, half of the cheese, the onion, and a few grinds of black pepper. Gently mix everything together and pour into the tart pan. Spread into an even layer. Scatter the remaining squash and cheese across the top. Bake in the oven until the egg is just set and the top is browned, 24 to 28 minutes. Remove the tart from the oven and allow it to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into slices and serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>BAKE<|>EVENT<|>Bake for 15 minutes to remove parchment and weights)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>Oven used for baking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CRUST<|>EVENT<|>Crust is cooling)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>FILLING<|>EVENT<|>Filling is being prepared)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SQUASH<|>EVENT<|>Squash is being baked)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SWISS CHARD<|>EVENT<|>Swiss chard is being sautéed)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>EVENT<|>Onion is being caramelized)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>EVENT<|>Egg is being mixed with chard)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>TART<|>EVENT<|>Tart is being baked)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is being used for cooking)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is being sautéed)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RED PEPPER FLAKES<|>EVENT<|>Red pepper flakes are being added to chard)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Balsamic vinegar is being added to onions)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Black pepper is being added to tart)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Cheese is being added to tart)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>BAKE<|>OVEN<|>Bake is taking place in the oven<|>9)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>CRUST<|>BAKE<|>Crust is being baked<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>FILLING<|>CRUST<|>Filling is being prepared while the crust is cooling<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>SQUASH<|>BAKE<|>Squash is being baked in the oven<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>SWISS CHARD<|>FILLING<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
