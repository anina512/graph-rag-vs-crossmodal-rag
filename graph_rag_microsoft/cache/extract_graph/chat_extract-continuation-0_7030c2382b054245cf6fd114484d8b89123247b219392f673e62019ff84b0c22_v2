Bring a pinch of kosher salt and 4 1/4 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Whisking constantly, gradually add chickpea flour. Once all the flour has been incorporated, reduce heat to low and cook mixture, whisking often to prevent scorching and to keep a skin from forming on top, until a thick lumpy porridge forms that is just starting to pull away from the sides of the saucepan, 20–25 minutes.\nTransfer mixture to a food processor (keep saucepan close at hand) and process until smooth and very glossy, about 45 seconds. Working quickly so mixture does not start to set, transfer back to saucepan, season with more kosher salt, and cook over low heat, whisking often to prevent any new lumps from forming, until you can see the bottom of pan while whisking and mixture no longer tastes raw, 10–15 minutes.\nScrape mixture into prepared pan and quickly smooth top. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over and cover with a sheet of parchment paper.

Heat remaining 1 1/2 cups oil in a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high until the first wisp of smoke appears. Working in 2 or 3 batches, fry strips (if panisses are not submerged in oil, add more just to cover), turning several times, until puffed, crisp, and golden all over, about 5 minutes per batch.
