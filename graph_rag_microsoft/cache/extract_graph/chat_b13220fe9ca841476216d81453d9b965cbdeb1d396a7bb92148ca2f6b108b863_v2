Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the greens and cook, tossing occasionally, until wilted and softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.\nWipe out the skillet and heat 2 cups oil over medium heat until a potato added to the oil sizzles gently. Add half the potatoes and onion to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove potato mixture with a slotted spoon and transfer to the bowl with the greens. Repeat with remaining potato mixture, reserving oil. Season potato mixture with 1 1/2 tablespoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the eggs and stir carefully to combine, keeping the potatoes intact.\nIn the same skillet over medium-high heat, add 1/4 cup reserved oil and swirl to coat. When the pan is hot, add the egg mixture and reduce the heat to low. Give it a shake and gently agitate the eggs in the middle of the pan with a spatula. As the tortilla sets, occasionally shake the pan and run the spatula along the rim to keep the tortilla from sticking.
