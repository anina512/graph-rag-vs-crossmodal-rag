Season pork belly all over with 4 teaspoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper.\nPlace chiles in a large roasting pan. Place pork belly, skin side down, on top of chiles; drizzle with 1/2 cup agave. Pour remaining 1/2 cup agave and 2 cups water into pan. Cover pan tightly with lid or two layers of foil.\nTransfer to oven and cook pork for 3 hours, basting with pan juices every hour.

Remove pan from heat. Let glaze cool; chill.\nMeanwhile, cover pork with parchment or waxed paper. Top with a large plate. Place weights, such as large canned goods, on top. Chill overnight.\nReheat glaze. Build a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush grill rack with oil. Grill pineapple until nicely charred, 2-3 minutes per side; place on plates.\nLet grill cool to medium heat. Slice pork belly into 1\"-thick pieces.
