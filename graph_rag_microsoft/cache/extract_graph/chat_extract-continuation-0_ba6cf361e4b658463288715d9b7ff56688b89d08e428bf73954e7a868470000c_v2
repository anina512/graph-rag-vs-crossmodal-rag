Grease a 13x9\" baking pan with room temperature butter or nonstick cooking spray, line the bottom with parchment, leaving a generous overhang on both long sides, and grease parchment with room temperature butter or nonstick cooking spray.\nCombine 1 1/2 cups butter, chocolate, and cocoa powder in a large heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, stirring often, until mixture is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and set aside.\nWhip eggs, sugar, and salt in bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer) on high speed, until tripled in size and lightened in color, 4–5 minutes. When you lift the whisk, the mixture should fall back on itself in thick ribbons and dissipate.\nAdd one-third egg mixture to reserved chocolate mixture and stir to combine with a spatula. Fold in remaining egg mixture in 2 batches. Sift in flour in three parts, gently folding with spatula after each addition. Pour evenly into prepared pan. Smooth top of batter with spatula.\nBake brownies, rotating in oven halfway through, until sides are visibly baked and center is set, 50–55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. After brownies have cooled, loosen edges with an offset spatula or a butter knife, then pull up both sides of the parchment to remove brownies from pan. Place brownies on parchment on a cutting board and cut into 15–18 pieces.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FUDGY DOUBLE-CHOCOLATE BROWNIES<|>EVENT<|>Fudgy Double-Chocolate Brownies is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate is a type of food used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCOA POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cocoa powder is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parchment is a type of paper used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stand mixer is a type of kitchen appliance used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hand mixer is a type of kitchen appliance used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of kitchen appliance used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFSET SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Offset spatula is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter knife is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUTTING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cutting board is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is a person who is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBA"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
