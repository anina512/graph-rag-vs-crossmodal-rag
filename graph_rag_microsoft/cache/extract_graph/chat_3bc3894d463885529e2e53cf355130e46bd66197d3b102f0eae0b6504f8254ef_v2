Place in a food processor, add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, and process to a fine paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add 2 pounds Napa cabbage, sliced crosswise into 1\" strips, 1/2 daikon, peeled, thinly sliced, and 4 thinly sliced scallions. Massage mixture with your hands until very well combined and cabbage starts releasing its liquid. Continue massaging until there is enough liquid to completely submerge cabbage (press it down into bowl to check).\nTransfer cabbage and liquid to a large crock or jar. Place a plate on top of cabbage and weight with a jar filled with pie weights or water so cabbage stays submerged. Seal crock or cover with cheesecloth and secure with a rubber band. Let sit at room temperature 5–7 days to ferment (the longer it sits, the more pronounced the flavor will be), then chill.\nKimchi can be made 6 months ahead.
