The rice will emerge as a golden-crusted cake, to be garnished with edible flowers and herbs, then served in wedges. NUSH-E JAN!\nNOTE: If using American long-grain rice, wash the rice once only and use only 3 cups of water in Step 2.\nVariation:Saffron Steamed Brown Basmati RiceFor 3 cups of brown basmati rice, use 6 3/4 cups water in Step 2. The amounts of salt, oil, and saffron water remain the same.\n•Batmanglij highly recommends using a rice cooker for this recipe — it's easier, and the nonstick, evenly heating surface ensures a good crust. She favors the National Deluxe brand — if you're using a different brand, check the instructions, as you may need to change the measurements and cooking times. •Though many Iranians now use vegetable oil, clarified butter (ghee) is Iran's traditional cooking fat. To make it, start with a third more unsalted butter than you will need for the recipe. Melt the butter over low heat, then increase the heat to medium low and simmer the butter, without stirring, until it stops crackling and the milk solids brown and drop to the bottom. Skim off any foam from the top, and strain the ghee through a colander lined with cheesecloth. Ghee will keep at room temperature, covered, for several months. •Batmanglij prefers Persian full-fat drained yogurt, which is thicker than the American variety. American nonfat yogurt can be substituted for a less rich flavor. •Batmanglij recommends buying saffron in thread form rather than powder, which is often adulterated with turmeric. Before they can be used in a recipe, the threads must be ground with a cube of sugar, using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and then diluted in hot water. \"The saffron water can then be stored and used as needed,\" says Batmanglij. \"Never use the unground threads.\"\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_0d603e2d837a612919c60879004c0dd0630eae80a489ffb1eab9093d904db410_v2"}
