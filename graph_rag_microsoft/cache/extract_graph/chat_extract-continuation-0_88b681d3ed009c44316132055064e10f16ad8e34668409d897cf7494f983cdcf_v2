Set aside.\nRoll each pizza dough half into circles the size of your cast-iron pan. The dough will probably be slightly thicker than what you're used to.\nHeat the pan to medium and add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add 1 piece of the rolled-out dough. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the dough is bubbly on top and browned underneath. Flip, add half of the sauce, half of the mozzarella, half of the ham, and half of the pineapple. Cook another 2 minutes, until the bottom is cooked, then slip under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, until the cheese looks bubbly and the pineapple is slightly caramelized. Top with basil. Remove the pizza from the pan, and repeat with the other piece of dough.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PAN-FRIED HAWAIIAN PIZZA<|>EVENT<|>Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza is a dish made with ham, pineapple, and mozzarella cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAM<|>PERSON<|>Ham is a type of cured meat used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIZZA SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pizza sauce is a type of sauce used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mozzarella cheese is a type of cheese used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PINEAPPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pineapple is a type of fruit used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Basil is a type of herb used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron pan is a type of cooking pan used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME MADE PIZZA DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Home made pizza dough is a type of dough used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STORE BOUGHT PIZZA DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Store bought pizza dough is a type of dough used in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAM<|>PAN-FRIED HAWAIIAN PIZZA<|>Ham is a key ingredient in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIZZA SAUCE<|>PAN-FRIED HAWAIIAN PIZZA<|>Pizza sauce is a key ingredient in the Pan-Fried Hawaiian Pizza recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>PAN-FRIED HAWAIIAN PIZZA<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
