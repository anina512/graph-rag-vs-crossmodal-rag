Spoon batter into springform pan, spreading evenly.\nBake cake until it begins to pull away from side of pan and a wooden toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then carefully run a thin knife around edge of cake and remove side of pan. Invert cake onto rack, then remove bottom of pan and carefully peel off paper. Let cake cool completely.\nCombine all ingredients except water and cornstarch in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir water into cornstarch in a small bowl, then stir into blueberry filling and gently boil, stirring, 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl and chill, uncovered, until cold.\nCombine all ingredients except water and cornstarch in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and briskly simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir water into cornstarch in a small bowl, then stir into raspberry filling and gently boil, stirring, 1 minute. Force filling through a large fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, scraping bottom of sieve to release pulp into bowl. Discard solids in sieve. Chill filling, uncovered, until cold.\nCut cooled cake horizontally into 3 even layers with a long serrated knife (see Cooks' Notes for an easy method). Line 9-inch springform pan with 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap, letting excess hang over edge. Put bottom layer, cut side up, in pan. Spread cold blueberry filling over cake using offset spatula, leaving a 1/4-inch border around edge, then freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.\nSlightly soften ice cream in microwave, then scoop half of it, preferably in thin curls that you can lay over blueberry layer, and gently spread it evenly to edge of cake. Return remaining ice cream to freezer. Put middle cake layer on top of ice cream, gently pressing it down, and spread cold raspberry filling\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Cake is a baked dessert made from flour, sugar, and eggs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUEBERRY FILLING<|>EVENT<|>Blueberry filling is a sweet and tangy sauce made from blueberries, sugar, and cornstarch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RASPBERRY FILLING<|>EVENT<|>Raspberry filling is a sweet and tangy sauce made from raspberries, sugar, and cornstarch)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from cream, sugar, and flavorings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPRINGFORM PAN<|>GEO<|>Springform pan is a type of baking pan used to make cakes and other desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>GEO<|>Wire rack is a kitchen tool used to cool baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>GEO<|>Toothpick is a small tool used to test the doneness of baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALICE<|>PERSON<|>Alice is the person making the cake)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>BLUEBERRY FILLING<|>Cake is topped with blueberry filling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>RASPBERRY FILLING<|>Cake is topped with raspberry filling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>ICE CREAM<|>Cake is topped with ice cream<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLUEBERRY FILLING<|>RASPBERRY FILLING<|>Blueberry and raspberry fillings are both used in the cake recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>SPRINGFORM PAN<|>Ice cream is scooped into the springform pan<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>WIRE RACK<|>Cake is cooled on a wire rack<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>TOOTHPICK<|>Cake is tested for doneness with a toothpick<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALICE<|>CAKE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
