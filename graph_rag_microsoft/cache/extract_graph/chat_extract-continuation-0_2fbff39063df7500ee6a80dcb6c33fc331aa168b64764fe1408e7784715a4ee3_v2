Butter a 9 × 5-inch loaf pan.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar. Whisk in the olive oil, milk, brandy, liqueur, lemon zest, orange zest, and 1/4 cup of the orange juice. Add the dry ingredients and whisk to combine. The batter is wet. It's okay.\nPour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 1 hour 5 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes, until a cake tester inserted in the cake comes out clean. You will smell the cake when it is done. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool enough to handle, then flip over onto a rack to cool thoroughly.\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup orange juice. Turn the cake right side up. Using a pastry brush, brush the glaze all over the cake. Allow the glaze to harden some before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGE OLIVE OIL POUND CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Orange Olive Oil Pound Cake is a recipe for a cake that includes olive oil and orange zest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE<|>GEO<|>Orange is a type of citrus fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>GEO<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COINTREAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cointreau is a brand of orange liqueur used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brandy is a type of spirit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE LIQUEUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange liqueur is a type of spirit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a type of leavening agent used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole milk is a type of liquid used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
