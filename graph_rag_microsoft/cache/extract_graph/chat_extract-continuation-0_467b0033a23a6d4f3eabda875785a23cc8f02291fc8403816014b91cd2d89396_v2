Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle boil, until the stock is reduced by half.\nFinish the sauce when you have retrieved rendered duck fat from the roasting duck. In a medium saucepan, warm the duck fat over medium heat. Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat–flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position.\nWhen the ducks have rested at least 20 minutes, use a sharp knife or poultry scissors to split them and cut the breasts from the legs. Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze. Watch them carefully; the sugar in the sauce caramelizes quickly.\nPlace the pieces on a platter, and decorate with thin, round slices of orange. Serve with additional sauce on the side.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPOT<|>GEO<|>A saucepan used for cooking the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DUCK<|>PERSON<|>A type of bird used for cooking the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COINTREAU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of liqueur used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VINEGARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of acidic liquid used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of liquid used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MARMALADE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of sweet and sour preserve used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGE PEEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of citrus peel used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BROILER<|>GEO<|>A device used for cooking the duck)\n## (\"entity\"<|>DUCK FAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of fat used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of powder used in the sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GIBLETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The internal organs of a bird used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NECKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The necks of a bird used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>STOCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A liquid used in cooking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of liquid used in cooking)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK<|>DUCK FAT<|>The duck was used to render the duck fat<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK<|>SAUCE<|>The duck was used to make the sauce<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>DUCK FAT<|>SAUCE<|>The duck fat was used to make the sauce<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>FLOUR<|>SAUCE<|>The flour was used to thicken the sauce<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GIBLETS<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
