Sprinkle mixture over whole-wheat flour mixture (sponge) in bowl of mixer to form blanket on top of sponge. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at least 1 hour, preferably up to 4 hours. (Starter can be made ahead and refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap, overnight. There is no need to bring starter to room temperature before proceeding.)\nAttach dough hook to stand mixer and mix starter on low (#2 on Kitchen Aid) until rough dough forms, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides of bowl, then cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rest 20 minutes. Add vegetable oil and mix on low until incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add salt and mix on low until dough is smooth, sticky enough to cling to fingers, and pulls away completely from bowl, about 7 minutes. If dough is not sticky, using spray bottle, spray with small amount of water and briefly knead by hand just until sticky.\nUsing vegetable oil or nonstick vegetable-oil spray, lightly oil 3-quart or larger bowl (or dough-rising container). Transfer dough to bowl and lightly oil or spray top of dough. Using tape, mark outside of bowl to approximately double current\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>50% WHOLE WHEAT SANDWICH BREAD<|>EVENT<|>50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread is a recipe for a type of bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>GEO<|>Water is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONEY<|>GEO<|>Honey is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>GEO<|>Whole wheat flour is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT YEAST<|>GEO<|>Instant yeast is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLD MEDAL \"BETTER FOR BREAD\" FLOUR<|>GEO<|>Gold Medal \"Better for Bread\" flour is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NON-FAT DRY MILK POWDER<|>GEO<|>Non-fat dry milk powder is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>GEO<|>Vegetable oil is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE SEA SALT<|>GEO<|>Fine sea salt is a key ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD FLOUR<|>GEO<|>Bread flour is a substitute ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNBLEACHED ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>GEO<|>Unbleached all-purpose flour is a substitute ingredient in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATER<|>HONEY<|>Water and honey are mixed together in the recipe for 50% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATER<|>WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR<|>Water and whole wheat flour are mixed together in the recipe for 50% Whole"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
