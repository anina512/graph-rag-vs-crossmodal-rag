Use only the larger rings for this recipe; reserve the smaller rings for another use. You should have 20 rings total. Lay the rings in a single layer in a large rectangular baking dish. Pour the milk over the rings and allow them to soak for about 20 minutes, turning them once so that all surfaces of the onion rings have been exposed to the milk.\nPreheat the oven to 425˚F. Place a wire baking rack on each of two foil-lined baking sheets, and set them aside.\nPut the flour in a shallow dish. Put the panko in a small dish. In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with a whisk until they are extremely foamy but not quite holding peaks.\nWorking in batches, remove the onion rings from the milk and dredge them in the flour, shaking off any excess. Add the rings to the egg whites and toss to coat completely. Add the rings, a few pieces at a time, to the panko and coat completely.\nSpread the onion rings out on the wire racks. Season the rings generously with salt and pepper, and spray them lightly with cooking spray. Bake until the panko is golden brown and crispy and the onions are tender, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and the liquid smoke. Season to taste with Tabasco.\nServe the onion rings with the mayonnaise for dipping.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>PERSON<|>Vidalia onions are a type of onion used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IAN'S ALL-NATURAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ian's All-Natural is a company that produces whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCCO'S MAGNIFICENT MAYONNAISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rocco's Magnificent Mayonnaise is a brand of mayonnaise used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELLMANN'S LOW-FAT MAYONNAISE DRESSING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hellmann's Low-Fat Mayonnaise Dressing is a brand of reduced-fat mayonnaise used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUBB'S<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stubb's is a company that produces liquid smoke used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABASCO SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tabasco sauce is a brand of hot sauce used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAUX-FRIED ONION RINGS<|>EVENT<|>Faux-Fried Onion Rings with Smoky Mayonnaise is a recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMOKY MAYONNAISE<|>EVENT<|>Smoky Mayonnaise is a sauce used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIDALIA ONIONS<|>IAN'S ALL-NATURAL<|>Vidalia onions are used with Ian's All-Natural panko breadcrumbs<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCCO'S MAGNIFICENT MAYONNAISE<|>HELLMANN'S LOW-FAT MAYONNAISE DRESSING<|>Rocco's Magnificent Mayonnaise and Hellmann's Low-Fat Mayonnaise Dressing are both used as mayonnaise in the recipe<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STUBB'S<|>TABASCO SAUCE<|>Stubb's liquid smoke and Tabasco sauce are used in the recipe<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FAUX-FRIED ONION RINGS<|>SMOKY MAYONNAISE<|>Smoky Mayonnaise is served with Faux-Fried Onion Rings<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
