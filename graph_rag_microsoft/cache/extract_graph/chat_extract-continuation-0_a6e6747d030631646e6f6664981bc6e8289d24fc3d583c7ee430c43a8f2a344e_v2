Add the lamb, stirring well to coat, and let it marinate in the refrigerator overnight. Take the lamb out of the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking (discard the marinade). Fire up your outdoor grill to very hot. Wipe the grill grates with a bit of oil and grill the lamb on high, about 5 minutes per side. Set the chops aside and let them rest for 10 minutes. (If you don’t have an outdoor grill, you can use a grill pan or cast-iron skillet.)\nIn a medium bowl, toss the green onions with the olive oil and sea salt and cook on the grill until blackened.

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text.
