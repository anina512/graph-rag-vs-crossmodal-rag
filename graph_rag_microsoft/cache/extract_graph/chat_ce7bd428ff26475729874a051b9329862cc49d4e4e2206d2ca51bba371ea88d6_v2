Knead with your hands or dough hook until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes. Form into a ball.\nLightly grease a large clean bowl with oil; transfer dough to bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, purée cheese, spinach, pepper, garlic powder, 5 Tbsp. butter, and remaining 1/4 tsp. kosher salt in a food processor until smooth. Add egg and pulse to combine.\nArrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece to a 14x8\" oval.\nTransfer 1 oval to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread half of spinach mixture in a thin layer over. Starting at long side, tightly roll dough around filling into a long tube (like a cinnamon roll).\nArrange tube diagonally on sheet. Starting 1\" from end closest to you, use sharp kitchen shears to make a deep incision at a 45-degree angle away from you, cutting almost to the bottom without cutting through. Carefully shift small cut piece to the left, keeping the bottom connected. Make another 45-degree incision 1\" from first. Carefully shift piece to the right.
