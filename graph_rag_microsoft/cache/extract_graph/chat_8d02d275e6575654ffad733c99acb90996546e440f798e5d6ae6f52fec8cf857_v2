Brush off any excess flour, then wrap dough in wax paper and chill at least 3 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375°F.\nRoll out dough on floured surface with floured rolling pin to a rough 16-inch square, then fit into a 10-inch (6-cup) glass pie plate. Trim excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang, then fold overhang under to form a rim (baked crust will not hold a crimp). Line pie shell with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake in middle of oven until edge of pastry is set and pale golden, 17 to 20 minutes.\nCarefully remove foil and weights, then prick bottom and side of pie shell all over with a fork. Bake, pricking again if any large air pockets form, until pie shell is golden all over, about 15 minutes more. (Leave oven on.)\nBeat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until combined well. Beat in sugar, milk, half-and-half, vanilla, and salt, then stir in flaked coconut.\nPour custard into hot pie shell and cover edge of pie with a pie shield or foil (to prevent overbrowning). Bake in middle of oven until custard is set 2 inches from edge but still jiggles slightly in center, 30 to 40 minutes. (Leave oven on.) Cool pie completely on a rack, about 1 1/2 hours.\nReduce oven temperature to 350°F.\nSpread coconut shavings in a shallow baking pan and bake in middle of oven, stirring once, until pale golden, about 5 minutes (watch carefully, since coconut burns easily). Cool in pan on rack.\nJust before serving, beat cream with sugar and vanilla in a bowl with cleaned beaters at medium speed until it just holds soft peaks. Spread cream over pie and sprinkle with toasted coconut.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8d02d275e6575654ffad733c99acb90996546e440f798e5d6ae6f52fec8cf857_v2"}
