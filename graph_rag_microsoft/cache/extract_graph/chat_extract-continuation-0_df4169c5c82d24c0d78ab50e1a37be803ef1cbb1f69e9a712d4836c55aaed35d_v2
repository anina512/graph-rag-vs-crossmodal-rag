Stir in the onion, lower the heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the beans, salt, and pepper and cook until the beans absorb some of the seasoning and are hot all the way through, about 2 minutes.

Place about 2 Tbsp of bean paste at the bottom end of the strip. Pull the bottom left corner of the strip to the right side, about 3 in [7.5 cm] up from the bottom, to create a triangle that encases the beans. Next, take the bottom right corner of the triangle and fold it away from you to the left edge of the lavash to enclose the filling, “rolling” the triangle up the lavash and adding a layer to the triangle. Continue to fold the triangle all the way up the strip until all of the lavash is used up. If any extra lavash hangs off the edge, trim it with scissors. Once finished, place the triangle seam-side down and repeat with the remaining strips and filling.\nLine a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.
