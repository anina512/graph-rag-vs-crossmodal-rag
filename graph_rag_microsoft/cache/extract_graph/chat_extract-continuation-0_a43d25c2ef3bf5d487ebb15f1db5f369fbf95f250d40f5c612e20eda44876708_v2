Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the oil, applesauce, salt, vanilla, and evaporated cane juice. In another medium bowl, whisk together the flour, flax meal, baking soda and xanthan gum. Using a rubber spatula, carefully add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until a grainy dough is formed. Gently fold in the chocolate chips just until they are evenly distributed through the dough.\nUsing a melon baller, scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing the portions 1 inch apart. Gently press each with the heel of your hand to help them spread. Bake the cookies on the center rack for 15 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees after 9 minutes. The finished cookies will be crisp on the edges and soft in the center.\nLet the cookies stand on the sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack and cool completely before covering. Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOB'S RED MILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bob's Red Mill is a company that produces gluten-free all-purpose baking flour)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate Chip Cookies is a type of baked good)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COOKIE SANDWICHES<|>EVENT<|>Cookie Sandwiches is a type of baked good)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>PERSON<|>Coconut oil is a type of oil used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLESAUCE<|>PERSON<|>Applesauce is a type of fruit puree used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>PERSON<|>Vanilla extract is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EVAPORATED CANE JUICE<|>PERSON<|>Evaporated cane juice is a type of sweetener used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BOB'S RED MILL GLUTEN-FREE ALL-PURPOSE BAKING FLOUR<|>PERSON<|>Bob's Red Mill gluten-free all-purpose baking flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLAX MEAL<|>PERSON<|>Flax meal is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>PERSON<|>Baking soda is a type of leavening agent used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>XANTHAN GUM<|>PERSON<|>Xanthan gum is a type of thickening agent used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>PERSON<|>Vegan chocolate chips are a type of chocolate used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>PERSON<|>Parchment paper is a type of paper used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MELON BALLER<|>PERSON<|>Melon baller is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>PERSON<|>Wire rack is a type of kitchen tool used in baking)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>PERSON<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
