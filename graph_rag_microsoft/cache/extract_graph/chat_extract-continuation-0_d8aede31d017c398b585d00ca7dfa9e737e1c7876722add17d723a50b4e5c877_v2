Add 2/3 cup ramp bulbs and stems to skillet and sauté just until soft but not browned, reducing heat if necessary to prevent browning, about 5 minutes. Transfer sautéed ramps to processor (do not clean skillet). Add green tops, cheese, almonds, and tarragon to processor; process until finely chopped. With machine running, gradually add 1/2 cup oil and puree until almost smooth. Transfer pesto to bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead; cover and chill.\nCook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally.\nMeanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in same large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper. Add salmon to skillet and cook just until opaque in center, about 4 minutes per side.\nDrain pasta, reserving 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot; add all but 1/4 cup pesto and toss to coat, adding enough pasta cooking liquid by tablespoonfuls to moisten. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta among plates. Top with salmon. Spread remaining 1/4 cup pesto over fish and serve.\nAvailable at some supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Italian markets.\n**Tender Spanish almonds that are usually sold roasted and salted; available at specialty foods stores and natural foods stores and from tienda.com.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SEARED SALMON WITH LINGUINE AND RAMP PESTO<|>EVENT<|>Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto is a recipe that combines the flavors of ramps, Asiago cheese, and salmon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARED SALMON WITH LINGUINE AND RAMP PESTO<|>EVENT<|>Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto is a recipe that combines the flavors of ramps, Asiago cheese, and salmon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINGUINE<|>FOOD<|>Linguine is a type of pasta used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMP PESTO<|>FOOD<|>Ramp Pesto is a sauce made from ramps, Asiago cheese, and almonds used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARED SALMON<|>FOOD<|>Seared Salmon is a dish made from salmon fillets used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>FOOD<|>Olive oil is used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMPS<|>FOOD<|>Ramps are a type of wild garlic used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASIAGO CHEESE<|>FOOD<|>Asiago cheese is a type of cheese used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCONA ALMONDS<|>FOOD<|>Marcona almonds are a type of almond used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TARRAGON<|>FOOD<|>Tarragon is a type of herb used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLETS<|>FOOD<|>Salmon fillets are used in the Seared Salmon with Linguine and Ramp Pesto recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASTA COOKING LIQUID<|>FOOD<|>Pasta"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
