We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information for each entity.

Gently simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally, 4 hours.\nStrain broth through a fine-mesh sieve lined with a damp paper towel into a large bowl, discarding solids. Skim off and discard any fat. Season with salt and pepper.\nPreheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.\nSimmer chives and half-and-half in a small heavy saucepan 5 minutes, then let stand, covered, 15 minutes.\nWhisk together egg and yolk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a 2-cup measure, then whisk in chive mixture until blended. Put mold on a rack in a roasting pan and put 1 teaspoon chive mixture in each cup (if using mini-muffin pans, fill only 16 cups; about 1 tablespoon per cup). You will have mixture left over.\nBake in a water bath until flan is just set, 8 to 10 minutes (10 to 12 if using muffin pans). Carefully remove mold from water bath. Cool flans at room temperature, then chill until cold, at least 1 hour.\nRun a thin knife around flans to loosen. Invert mold onto a baking sheet and, pressing gently, pop out flans (or lift out of muffin pans with a small offset spatula).\nCarefully transfer flans to 8 shallow bowls and ladle in hot broth.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f7dcb093b55cfaa8b9d6ad71df8ba2015c0fd610da7e24dbf0ea91c750902bb0_v2"}
