Nestle the short ribs in the cooking liquid to cover. Bring the liquid to a simmer on the stovetop, then cover and transfer to the oven to braise for 2 hours. Uncover pot and continue to braise in the oven until beef is very tender and falling off the bone, 30 to 60 minutes more.\nMeanwhile, set a large pot of salted water to boil. Peel and roughly chop remaining carrots and parsnips. Add cook carrots and parsnips to boiling water and cook until tender when pierced with a knife, about 15 minutes. Drain vegetables and return them to the pot. Add milk, butter, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Use an immersion blender, potato masher or a fork to blend or mash to desired consistency (it can be as smooth or chunky as you like). Taste and adjust seasoning. Place a lid on the pot and reserve until ready to serve.\nWhen short ribs are done, transfer them from cooking liquid to a plate. Set a strainer over a large bowl, and strain cooking liquid. Discard solids and pour strained cooking liquid back into Dutch oven. Set pot over medium-high heat and simmer until liquid is reduced by half and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Gently reheat carrot-parsnip purée.\nServe short ribs over carrot-parsnip purée, topped with its sauce and a sprinkling of cilantro.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOIL<|>EVENT<|>A boil is a cooking method where liquid is heated to a rolling boil>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMMER<|>EVENT<|>A simmer is a cooking method where liquid is heated to a low point where it is just barely bubbling>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIQUID<|>EVENT<|>Liquid is a substance that is used in cooking to add moisture and flavor to dishes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARROT<|>GEO<|>Carrot is a type of root vegetable that is commonly used in cooking>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSNIPT<|>GEO<|>Parsnip is a type of root vegetable that is commonly used in cooking>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>GEO<|>Onion is a type of vegetable that is commonly used in cooking>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>GEO<|>Garlic is a type of vegetable that is commonly used in cooking for its flavor and health benefits>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAY LEAVES<|>GEO<|>Bay leaves are a type of herb that is commonly used in cooking for its flavor and aroma>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHORT RIBS<|>GEO<|>Short ribs are a type of cut of beef that is commonly used in cooking for its flavor and tenderness>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROTH<|>GEO<|>Broth is a liquid that is used in cooking to add moisture and flavor to dishes>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>GEO<|>Cilantro is a type of herb that is commonly used in cooking for its flavor and aroma>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOVETOP<|>GEO<|>Stovetop is a cooking surface that is used to heat and cook food>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>Oven is a cooking appliance that is used to heat and cook food>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUTCH OVEN<|>GEO<|>Dutch oven is a type of cooking pot that is commonly used for braising and stewing>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>GEO<|>Salt is a seasoning that is commonly used in cooking"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
