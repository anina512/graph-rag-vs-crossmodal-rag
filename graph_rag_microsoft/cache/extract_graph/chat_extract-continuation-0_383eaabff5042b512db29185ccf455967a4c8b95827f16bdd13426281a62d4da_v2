Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cream, white pepper, parsley, and chives together until combined. Fold in the potato chips until they are completely covered in the egg mixture, but try not to crush the chips too much. Let stand for 10 minutes, until the chips soften slightly.\n2. Heat the butter in an ovenproof 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, swirling the pan to coat the bottom completely, until very hot. Carefully pour in the egg mixture and spread it evenly in the pan, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Cook until the eggs are set and the bottom is light golden, about 15 minutes. If the bottom is golden but the eggs are still runny on the top, transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the eggs are completely set, 3 to 4 minutes.\n3. To serve, invert a large flat plate over the pan and flip the pan and the plate to invert the omelet onto the plate. Let stand for at least 5 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>EVENT<|>A recipe for a potato chip omelet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>EVENT<|>A recipe for a potato chip omelet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>PERSON<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>PERSON<|>Heavy cream is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE PEPPER<|>PERSON<|>White pepper is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>PERSON<|>Parsley is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIVES<|>PERSON<|>Chives are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POTATO CHIPS<|>PERSON<|>Potato chips are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>PERSON<|>Butter is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Vegetable oil is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>The oven is a common cooking appliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>A skillet is a common cooking vessel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATE<|>GEO<|>A plate is a common serving dish)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the potato chip omelet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>Heavy cream is a key ingredient in the potato chip omelet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITE PEPPER<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>White pepper is a key ingredient in the potato chip omelet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARSLEY<|>POTATO CHIP OMELET<|>Parsley is a key ingredient in the potato chip omelet<|>8)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
