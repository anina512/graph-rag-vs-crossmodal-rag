We'll identify entities of the types specified in the `entity_types` list.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the entities\nentities = []\n\n# Iterate over the entities in the document\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    # Check if the entity type is in the list of entity types\n    if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n        # Extract the entity information\n        entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n        entity_type = ent.label_\n        entity_description = ent.text\n\n        # Format the entity as a string\n        entity = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}>{entity_description})\"\n\n        # Add the entity to the list\n        entities.append(entity)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(entity)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Relationship Identification**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify relationships between entities.
