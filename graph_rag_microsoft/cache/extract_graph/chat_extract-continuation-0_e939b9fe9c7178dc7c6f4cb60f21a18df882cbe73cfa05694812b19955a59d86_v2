Increase speed and beat until peaks form. Using electric mixer with clean dry beaters, beat egg whites and pinch of salt in medium bowl until foamy. With mixer running, gradually beat in sugar, then beat until peaks form. Fold egg white mixture into cream mixture in 2 additions. Fold in almonds, if desired. Transfer to container, cover, and freeze overnight.\nPreheat oven to 350°. Line 2 large baking sheets with foil. Mix first 7 ingredients in bowl. Stir butter and honey in another medium bowl. Add flour mixture; stir to blend (dough will be thin). Let stand at room temperature 20 minutes to thicken. DO AHEAD: Can be made 4 hours ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.\nSpoon dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared sheets, spacing apart (about 6 cookies per sheet). Bake until deep golden, lacy, and bubbling, 9 to 10 minutes. Cool cookies on sheet 5 minutes. Using thin metal spatula, transfer cookies to racks to cool. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\nDivide honey mousse among 8 shallow serving dishes. Garnish each serving with 1 cookie and serve, passing remaining cookies separately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
