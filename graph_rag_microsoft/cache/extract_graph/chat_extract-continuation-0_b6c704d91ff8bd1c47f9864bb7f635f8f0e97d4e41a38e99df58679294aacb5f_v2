Butter an 8-inch square cake pan and line with a square of parchment paper, then butter parchment.\nSift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\nBeat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in vanilla. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, beat in buttermilk until just combined (mixture may look curdled). Add flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing until each addition is just incorporated.\nSpread batter evenly in cake pan, then rap pan on counter several times to eliminate air bubbles. Bake until golden and a wooden pick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in pan on a rack 10 minutes, then run a knife around edge of pan. Invert onto rack and discard parchment, then cool completely, about 1 hour.\nBring cream, brown sugar, corn syrup, and a pinch of salt to a boil in a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Boil until glaze registers 210 to 212°F on thermometer, 12 to 14 minutes, then stir in vanilla.\nPut rack with cake in a shallow baking pan and pour hot glaze over top of cake, allowing it to run down sides. Cool until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Cake is a type of baked dessert made from a mixture of ingredients including flour, sugar, eggs, and butter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake flour is a type of flour used in baking cakes, made from wheat flour that has been sifted to remove impurities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product made from the fat of milk, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener made from sugarcane or sugar beets, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a type of flavoring made from the seeds of the vanilla orchid, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of food made from the reproductive cells of chickens, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTERMILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buttermilk is a type of dairy product made from the liquid left over after churning butter, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a type of dairy product made from the fat of milk, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHT BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Light brown sugar is a type of sweetener made from sugarcane or sugar beets, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHT CORN SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Light corn syrup is a type of sweetener made from cornstarch, used in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDY THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Candy thermometer is a type of kitchen tool used to measure the temperature of sugar mixtures)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>Cake is made from cake flour<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>BUTTER<|>Cake is made with"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
