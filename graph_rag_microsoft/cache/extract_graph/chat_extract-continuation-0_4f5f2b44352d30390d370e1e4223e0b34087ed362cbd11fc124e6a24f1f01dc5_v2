Roll mixture into 4 balls.\nRub one 16x12\" piece of parchment with a little bit of oil. Place 1 ball of meat on one half of oiled paper, then fold other half over. Using a rolling pin or wine bottle, gently roll meat into a very thin oval between parchment (it should be about 9x6\"). Transfer, with parchment, to a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 3 more sheets of paper and remaining meat. Chill until ready to use.\nSlice kernels off ears of corn and transfer to a large bowl. Add tomato, onion, avocado, chile, lime juice, and remaining 1/4 cup cilantro, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. chili powder and stir to combine. Let sit while you cook the patties.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large heavy (preferably cast-iron) skillet until smoking. Working one at a time, peel patty off greased parchment and sear until browned and crisped on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook just until cooked through, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining patties.\nTop patties with corn salsa.\nDo Ahead: Patties can be formed 2 days ahead.
