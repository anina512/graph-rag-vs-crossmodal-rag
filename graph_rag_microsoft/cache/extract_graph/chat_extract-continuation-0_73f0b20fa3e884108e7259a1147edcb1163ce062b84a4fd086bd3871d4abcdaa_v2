Add 8 quarts fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat so the liquid is at a simmer and skim off any scum that rises to the surface.\n4. After 45 minutes, ready an ice-water bath, then check the brisket for doneness by using the chopstick test: transfer the brisket to a plate and poke it with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. If they do not, return the brisket to the pot and continue cooking, checking again in 10 minutes. When the brisket is done, remove it from the pot (reserving the cooking liquid) and immediately submerge it in the ice-water bath, which will stop the cooking and give the meat a firmer texture. When the brisket is completely cool, remove from the water, pat dry, and refrigerate.\n5. Continue to simmer the stock for another 2 hours, skimming as needed to remove any scum that forms on the surface. Remove from the heat and remove and discard the large solids. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large saucepan. Skim most of the fat from the surface of the stock (leave some, as it gives the stock a better flavor and mouthfeel). Return the stock to a simmer over medium heat.\n6. In a spice grinder or mortar and pestle, grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder. In a frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the ground red pepper flakes and annatto seeds and cook, stirring, for 10 seconds. Add the shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and shrimp paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more, until the mixture is aromatic and the shallots are just beginning to soften.\n7. Add the contents of the frying pan to the simmering stock along with the salt and sugar and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and sugar.\n8. To ready the garnishes, arrange the basil, perilla, cabbage, lemon and lime wedges, and onion slices on a platter and place on the table. Thinly slice the brisket against the grain. Divide the cooked noodles among warmed soup bowls, then divide the brisket slices evenly among the bowls, placing them on top of the noodles\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COOKING LIQUID<|>EVENT<|>The cooking liquid is a mixture of water and the juices from the brisket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRISKET<|>EVENT<|>The brisket is a cut of beef that is being cooked in the pot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE-WATER BATH<|>EVENT<|>The ice-water bath is used to stop the cooking of the brisket and give it a firmer texture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH SIEVE<|>EVENT<|>The fine-mesh sieve is used to strain the stock and remove the large solids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE GRINDER<|>EVENT<|>The spice grinder is used to grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MORTAR AND PESTLE<|>EVENT<|>The mortar and pestle is used to grind the red pepper flakes and annatto seeds into a coarse powder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIED PAN<|>EVENT<|>The frying pan is used to cook the mixture of red pepper flakes, annatto seeds, shallots, garlic, lemongrass, and shrimp paste)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMMERING STOCK<|>EVENT<|>The simmering stock is a mixture of the cooking liquid and the contents of the frying pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED PEPPER FLAKES<|>EVENT<|>Red pepper flakes are used to add heat to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNATTO SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Annatto seeds are used to add color to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>EVENT<|>Shallots are used to add flavor to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is used to add flavor to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONGRASS<|>EVENT<|>Lemongrass is used to add flavor to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHRIMP PASTE<|>EVENT<|>Shrimp paste is used to add umami flavor to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is used to add flavor to the stock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
