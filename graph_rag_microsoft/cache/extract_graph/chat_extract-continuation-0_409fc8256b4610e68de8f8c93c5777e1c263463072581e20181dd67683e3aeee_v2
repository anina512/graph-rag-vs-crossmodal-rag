Spread cubed bread on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until browned but still soft inside, 7 to 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place the white wine and garlic in a small pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and reduce the wine until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. (Be careful not to reduce too much and scorch the wine and the garlic.) Scrape wine-garlic mixture into a medium bowl.\nAdd the butter, red-pepper flakes, oregano, and salt to the bowl with the wine-garlic mixture. Use a wooden spoon to fully incorporate the ingredients into the butter. Leave at room temperature until serving.\nSpread a generous amount (about 3/4 teaspoon) of the flavored butter onto one side of each toast cube. Arrange toast cubes buttered side up on the rimmed baking sheet and return to oven until butter is melted, 3 to 5 minutes.\nArrange the cubes on a serving platter and sprinkle with herbs. Serve immediately.\nThe flavored butter can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
