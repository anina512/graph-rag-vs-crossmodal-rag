Pour the chilled custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer so you can use it to store the finished ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles \"soft serve.\" In the last 30 seconds of churning, add the crumble and the cooked apples. You can also manually fold the crumble and apples into the ice cream. Transfer the ice cream to the chilled storage container and freeze until hardened to your desired consistency. Alternatively, you can serve it immediately—it will be the consistency of gelato. The ice cream will keep, frozen, for up to 7 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CUSTARD<|>EVENT<|>Custard is a type of dessert that can be turned into ice cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE CREAM MAKER<|>EVENT<|>Ice cream maker is a device used to churn ice cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINER<|>EVENT<|>Container is used to store and freeze ice cream)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>EVENT<|>Apples are a common ingredient in ice cream recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRUMBLE<|>EVENT<|>Crumble is a topping used in ice cream recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GELATO<|>EVENT<|>Gelato is a type of frozen dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from custard)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTARD<|>ICE CREAM<|>Custard is a key ingredient in making ice cream<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICE CREAM MAKER<|>ICE CREAM<|>Ice cream maker is used to churn ice cream<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTAINER<|>ICE CREAM<|>Container is used to store and freeze ice cream<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLES<|>ICE CREAM<|>Apples are a common ingredient in ice cream recipes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CRUMBLE<|>ICE CREAM<|>Crumble is a topping used in ice cream recipes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GELATO<|>ICE CREAM<|>Gelato and ice cream are both frozen desserts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICE CREAM<|>GELATO<|>Ice cream and gelato are both frozen desserts<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
