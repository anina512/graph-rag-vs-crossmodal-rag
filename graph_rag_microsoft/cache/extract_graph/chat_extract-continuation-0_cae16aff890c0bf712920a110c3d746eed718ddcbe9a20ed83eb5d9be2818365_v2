Line loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the long sides, and lightly coat with nonstick spray.\nWhisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk lemon zest into sugar in a large bowl until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add eggs, oil, and vanilla and whisk until light in color and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk in half of the dry ingredients, then whisk in yogurt. Whisk in remaining dry ingredients. Add lemon juice and whisk to combine. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth top.\nBake cake, rotating pan halfway through, until top is golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 55–60 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool, about 2 hours.\nBring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add blueberries, then reduce to a simmer. Smash blueberries with the back of a spoon and continue to simmer 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, sprinkle gelatin over 1/3 cup cold water in a small bowl; let sit 10 minutes to soften.\nStrain blueberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, pressing blueberries with the back of spoon to release juices. Whisk about 1/3 cup blueberry syrup into gelatin mixture, stirring to dissolve, then pour gelatin mixture over remaining blueberry syrup and stir to combine. Chill at least 1 1/2 hours.\nRun a knife around sides of cooled cake to loosen.
