Using a handheld whisk, combine eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place bowl on top of saucepan (it should not touch water) and cook egg mixture, whisking constantly, until lightened in color, thickened slightly, and an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F. Remove from heat and beat with stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed until completely cooled and tripled in volume, about 10 minutes. Add butter, 1–2 Tbsp. at a time, beating well after each addition until fully incorporated. Add vanilla and lemon curd and beat on medium-low speed until just combined.\nButtercream can be made and refrigerated up to 5 days in advance or frozen up to 1 month. To use refrigerated buttercream, let sit at room temperature until soft, at least 2 hours. Beat with stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth. If texture is not smooth, beat in a little water, 1 tsp. at a time. To defrost, transfer buttercream from freezer to refrigerator to thaw overnight. Then follow the instructions for using refrigerated buttercream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE-EGG LEMON BUTTERCREAM<|>EVENT<|>Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream is a recipe for a type of buttercream frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON CURD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon curd is a key ingredient in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A stand mixer is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANDHELD WHISK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A handheld whisk is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A saucepan is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An instant-read thermometer is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PADDLE ATTACHMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A paddle attachment is used in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>SUGAR<|>Eggs and sugar are combined in the Whole-Egg Lemon Buttercream recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>SALT<|>E"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
