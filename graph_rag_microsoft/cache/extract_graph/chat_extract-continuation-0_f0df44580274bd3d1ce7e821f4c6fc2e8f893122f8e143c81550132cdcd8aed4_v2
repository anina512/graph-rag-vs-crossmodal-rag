Place the cream, tea bags, and salt in a heat-proof measuring cup and microwave for 1 minute. (Alternatively, heat these ingredients in a small saucepan just until they simmer, then cool for 1 minute.) Remove the tea bags. In a medium bowl, stir together the cream mixture and the melted chocolate. Add the vanilla. Keep stirring until the mixture smooths into a well-blended ganache.\n2 Cool the ganache in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\n3 With two spoons, scoop 1-in/2.5-cm balls of the ganache onto a baking sheet. Roll the balls with your hands into smooth, uniform shapes. Chill if necessary.\n4 Sift the matcha and powdered sugar together in a small bowl. Mix in the cereal. Dip each ganache ball into the matcha mixture and shake off the excess.
