We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationships\nrelationships = {\n    \"ORGANIZATION\": [\"headquarters\", \"founded\", \"acquired\"],\n    \"PERSON\": [\"born\", \"died\", \"married\"],\n    \"GEO\": [\"capital\", \"located\"],\n    \"EVENT\": [\"date\", \"location\"]\n}\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Golden Dinner Rolls\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['1/2 small (about 4 ounces/112 grams) orange-fleshed sweet potato (also called yam)', '1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (8 ounces/224 grams) unbleached all-purpose flour', '1/3 cup plus 4 teaspoons (3.5 ounces/98 grams) water, room temperature (70°F to 90°F)', '1 1/2 teaspoons honey', '3/4 teaspoon instant yeast (also known as rapid-rise or bread machine yeast)', '1 1/2 tablespoons non-fat dry milk powder', '1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened, plus 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled', '3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt', 'stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and dough hook, 3-quart or larger bowl or dough-rising container, masking tape, dough scraper or spatula, heavy baking sheet, baking stone or second heavy baking sheet, aluminum-foil-lined cast-iron pan or heavy rimmed baking pan']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nPreheat oven to 375°F.

Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
