Mix 5 tsp. red food coloring and 2 Tbsp. raspberry powder into last bowl of batter. (This will create three shades of red/pink batter.)\nScrape a bowl of batter into each prepared pan and smooth tops. Bake cakes, rotating pans halfway through, until center springs back when gently pressed, 12–15 minutes. Let cakes cool completely in pans.\nRemove lightest-colored cake from pan, turning out onto a surface, and carefully peel away parchment paper. Spread half of jam evenly over top. Remove medium-colored cake from pan, peel away parchment paper, and place on top of light cake. Spread evenly with remaining jam. Remove darkest-colored cake from its pan, peel away parchment paper, and place on top. Press down gently to adhere layers and wrap tightly in plastic; chill at least 1 hour.\nTo make cookies, trim edges to square off; about 1/2\" on each side should do it. Then, using a serrated knife, cut cake crosswise into 1 1/2\"-wide strips (you should have 8 total). Cut strips crosswise into 3/4\"-thick pieces.\nCakes can be assembled 5 days ahead; wrap tightly and keep chilled. Cut into pieces just before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Goal\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n### Steps\n1.
