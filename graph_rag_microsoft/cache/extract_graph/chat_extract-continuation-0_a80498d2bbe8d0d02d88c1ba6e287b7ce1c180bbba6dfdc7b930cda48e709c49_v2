Combine broken graham crackers, diced butter, and sugar in processor. Blend until crumbs stick together. Press crumb mixture onto bottom and 2 1/2 inches up sides of 9-inch-diameter springform pan. Bake crust until golden, about 12 minutes. Cool crust on rack. Maintain oven temperature.\nBeat cream cheese and peanut butter in large bowl until blended and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add both sugars and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla, then eggs 1 at a time, then sour cream. Scrape cheesecake batter into crust.\nStack 3 large pieces of foil on work surface and place springform pan in center. Fold foil snugly up sides of pan. Place springform pan in roasting pan. Add enough water to roasting pan to come 1 inch up sides of springform pan.\nBake cheesecake in water bath until sides are puffed and center is set and edges are beginning to brown, about 1 hour 25 minutes. Place hot cheesecake directly in refrigerator; chill uncovered until cold, at least 6 hours and up to 1 day.\nWhisk diced butter and sugar in heavy large skillet over mediumlow heat until butter melts, sugar dissolves, and smooth caramel sauce bubbles thickly, about 4 minutes. Slice bananas into 1/2-inch-thick, 2-inch-long diagonal slices, discarding ends. Working in batches if necessary, add banana slices to skillet in single layer and cook over medium heat until heated through and coated, turning once,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PEANUT BUTTER CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>Peanut Butter Cheesecake is a dessert with a caramelized banana topping)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMELIZED BANANA TOPPING<|>EVENT<|>Caramelized banana topping is a topping for the Peanut Butter Cheesecake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAHAM CRACKERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Graham crackers are a type of cracker used in the crust of the Peanut Butter Cheesecake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsalted BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in the crust and topping of the Peanut Butter Cheesecake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cream cheese is a type of cheese used in the cheesecake batter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEANUT BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peanut butter is a type of nut butter used in the cheesecake batter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bananas are a type of fruit used in the caramelized banana topping)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is not in the text, so I will ignore this entity"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
