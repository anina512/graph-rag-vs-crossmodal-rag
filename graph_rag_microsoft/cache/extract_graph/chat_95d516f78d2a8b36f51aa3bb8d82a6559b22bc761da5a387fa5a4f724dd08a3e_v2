Cut the jalapeños in half and scrape the core (seeds and membranes) of two into a food-safe container. Dice the remaining jalapeños and place into the food-safe container. Add the tequila and allow to infuse for 12 to 20 minutes, depending on spice level desired. Rebottle.\nNote: The recipe for the jalapeño tequila will vary because not all jalapeños are equally spicy. You need to taste it frequently to make sure it’s right. Ensure your tequila is not cold, as cold tequila will not infuse properly.\nBlend the watermelon in a blender to yield about 12 ounces of juice. Add the sugar and blend again until fully dissolved. Transfer to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nAdd all the ingredients, except for 1 mint leaf, the lime wheel, and salt, to a cocktail shaker with ice. Wet the outside of a coupe glass with the lime wheel and roll the glass in salt for a salted rim. Shake and fine-strain into the glass. Garnish with the mint leaf—first pressed lightly to express its oils—by floating it on top of the drink.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_95d516f78d2a8b36f51aa3bb8d82a6559b22bc761da5a387fa5a4f724dd08a3e_v2"}
