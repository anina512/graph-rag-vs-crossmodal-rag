Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until potatoes are tender, 20–25 minutes. Increase heat and boil rapidly until pan is almost dry, 15–20 minutes more (there will still be a sheen of butterfat).\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer about half of potatoes to a plate and arrange potatoes remaining in skillet cut side down in a single layer (if your skillet is smaller, you may need to work in a few batches). Reduce heat to medium and cook potatoes undisturbed until water is evaporated and cut sides of potatoes are deeply browned, 5–10 minutes.\nUsing a thin metal spatula, scrape skillet to cleanly release potatoes and transfer to a large bowl. Return skillet to medium heat, add 1 Tbsp. butter, and repeat browning process with reserved potatoes. After scraping skillet to release potatoes, return first batch, along with parsley and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, to skillet and toss until potatoes are well coated. Serve sprinkled with sea salt.\nPotatoes can be boiled 4 hours ahead. Let cool in skillet, then cover and let sit at room temperature. Brown just before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Lemon is used in the recipe as a key ingredient for flavor and moisture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>EVENT<|>Parsley is used in the recipe as a garnish and for added flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>EVENT<|>Fingerling potatoes are the main ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SKILLET-ROASTED FINGERLING POTATOES<|>EVENT<|>The dish is a recipe for skillet-roasted fingerling potatoes)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>EVENT<|>Lemon juice is used in the recipe to add flavor and moisture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the recipe to add flavor and texture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is used in the recipe to add flavor and moisture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLAKY SEA SALT<|>EVENT<|>Flaky sea salt is used in the recipe as a garnish and for added flavor)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>LEMON<|>PARSLEY<|>Lemon and parsley are used together in the recipe to add flavor and moisture<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>LEMON<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>Lemon is used to add flavor and moisture to the fingerling potatoes<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PARSLEY<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>Parsley is used to add flavor and moisture to the fingerling potatoes<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>Kosher salt is used to add flavor and texture to the fingerling potatoes<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>Unsalted butter is used to add flavor and moisture to the fingerling potatoes<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>FLAKY SEA SALT<|>FINGERLING POTATOES<|>Flaky sea salt is used as a garn"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
