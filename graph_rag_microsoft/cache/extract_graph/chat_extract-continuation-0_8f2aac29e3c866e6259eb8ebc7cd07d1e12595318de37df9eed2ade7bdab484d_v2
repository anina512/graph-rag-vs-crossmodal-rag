Season each fish on both sides with salt and pepper. Whisk remaining ingredients in a bowl; spoon over each fish. Seal foil loosely around each fish to create a somewhat roomy pocket. Bake 10 minutes per inch of thickness of fish at its thickest part (typically 20 to 25 minutes for a 2-inch-thick fish).
