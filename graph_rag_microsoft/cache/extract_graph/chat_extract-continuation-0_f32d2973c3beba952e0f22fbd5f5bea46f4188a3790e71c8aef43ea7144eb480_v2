In a heavy, wide 4-quart pot or sauté pan over moderately high heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and sauté, stirring occasionally, until light brown and caramelized, about 5 minutes. (Note that because they are sautéed so quickly over moderately high heat, the onions will not caramelize evenly.) Reduce the heat to moderate then stir in the spice and ginger mixture. Add the tomato purée, water, heavy cream, and salt, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat to gently simmer the sauce, uncovered, until thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. DO AHEAD: The sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, in an airtight container, up to 3 days.\nHeat a heavy 11- to 12-inch griddle or skillet over moderately high heat until very hot and add 1/2 tablespoon of peanut oil. Working in two batches, cook the chicken breasts, turning them a few times and lowering the heat if the chicken chars too quickly, until just cooked through and browned well on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer the chicken as cooked to a cutting board. Wipe the griddle or skillet clean with a paper towel and cook the remaining chicken, adding the remaining 1/2 tablespoon peanut oil between batches.\nWhen all the chicken is cooked, cut it into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the simmering sauce and continue to gently simmer it, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the black pepper and chopped cilantro, and season with salt. DO AHEAD: Chicken tikka masala can be prepared ahead, cooled, uncovered, and refrigerated, covered, up to 3 days.\nTransfer the chicken to a serving dish and garnish with additional cilantro sprigs. Serve with naan, and/or if desired with Basmati Rice .\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a dairy product used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Onion is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of root used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato is a type of fruit used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy cream is a dairy product used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEANUT OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peanut oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken is a type of meat used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Naan is a type of bread used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASMATI RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Basmati rice is a type of rice used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cilantro is a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spice is a type of seasoning used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a liquid used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Griddle is a type of cooking surface used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Skillet is a type of cooking surface used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pot is a type of cooking vessel used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUTÉ PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sauté pan is"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
