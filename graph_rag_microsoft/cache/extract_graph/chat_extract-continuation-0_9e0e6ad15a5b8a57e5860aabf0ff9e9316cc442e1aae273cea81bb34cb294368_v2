Spread the flour on a plate and spread the panko on a second plate.\nWhen the oil is ready, using chopsticks or tongs, dredge a peach slice in the flour, shaking off the excess, and then dip in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off. Finally, dredge the slice in the panko, covering it as evenly as possible with the light flakes.\nCarefully place the peach slice in the hot oil. It should immediately begin to bubble and hiss. While the first slice is cooking, continue to dredge and dip more slices in the flour, egg, and panko and add them to the oil. Fry no more than 3 or 4 slices at a time, making sure they do not touch one another, for about 1 minute, until evenly golden. Using a wire skimmer, transfer the finished slices to a wire rack set over a shallow bowl or pan to drain briefly. Serve piping hot.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PANKO-FRIED PEACHES<|>EVENT<|>Panko-Fried Peaches is a recipe for cooking peaches in a deep fryer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANOLA OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canola oil is a type of oil used for deep-frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peaches are a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used for dredging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANKO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Panko is a type of breadcrumb used for coating)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEEP-FRYER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deep-fryer is a type of cooking equipment used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wok is a type of cooking equipment used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Saucepan is a type of cooking equipment used for frying)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOPSTICKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chopsticks are a type of utensil used for dredging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tongs are a type of utensil used for dredging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE SKIMMER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire skimmer is a type of utensil used for transferring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of equipment used for draining)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOW BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shallow bowl is a type of equipment used for draining)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pan is a type of equipment used for draining)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
