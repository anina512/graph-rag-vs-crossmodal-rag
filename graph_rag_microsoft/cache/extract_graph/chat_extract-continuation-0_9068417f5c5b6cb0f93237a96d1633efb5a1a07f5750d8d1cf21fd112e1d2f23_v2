Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, evaporating the alcohol. Let the syrup cool completely.\nIn another large bowl, stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon to soften it, then drop in the grated lemon zest and beat until light and creamy. Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks.\nWhen the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.\nPour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly—if it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.\nScoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream.\nSmooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramisù airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramisù in any size you like, and life each out of the pan and onto dessert plates.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A saucepan is a kitchen vessel used for cooking and heating liquids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a citrus fruit used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mascarpone is a type of Italian cheese used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is a common ingredient in baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a sweetener used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A wooden spoon is a kitchen utensil used for mixing and stirring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON ZEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon zest is the grated skin of a lemon used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADYFINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ladyfingers are a type of cookie used in desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRAMISU<|>EVENT<|>Tiramisu is a type of Italian dessert made with ladyfingers and mascarpone cheese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is a type of kitchen wrap used for covering and storing food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREEZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A freezer is a kitchen appliance used for storing and preserving food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFRIGERATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A refrigerator is a kitchen appliance used for storing and preserving food)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>LEMON<|>The saucepan is used to cook the lemon juice<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>LEMON ZEST<|>The mascarpone is mixed with lemon zest to create a creamy dessert<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGG<|>SUGAR<|>The egg whites are whipped with sugar to create a light and firm texture<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>MASCARP"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
