Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and brush with 1 Tbsp. oil. Arrange polenta rounds on oiled sheet.\nVery coarsely chop (do not purée) half the tomatoes in a food processor. Cut remaining tomatoes in half (quarter if large). Combine tomatoes in a bowl with 4 tablespoons oil and remaining ingredients. Toss to coat.\nStack three 24x12\" sheets of parchment paper on another baking sheet. (Don't use foil-the tomato acid will react with aluminum.) Spoon tomato mixture onto one side of stacked parchment. Fold parchment layers over mixture and crimp edges tightly to form a sealed packet.\nPlace baking sheet with tomato packet on upper rack and sheet with polenta on lower rack. Bake, turning polenta rounds once, until polenta is light golden and tomatoes are saucy (carefully open packet to check; steam will escape), 25-30 minutes. (You can also cook polenta in a grill pan or on a charcoal or gas grill.)\nSpoon tomato sauce over polenta.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO-BASIL SAUCE WITH POLENTA<|>EVENT<|>Tomato-Basil Sauce with Polenta is a recipe for a dish made with polenta and tomato sauce)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>POLENTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Polenta is a type of Italian dish made from cornmeal)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BASIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Basil is a type of herb used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shallot is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a type of spice used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, but rather in the example)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not in the text, but rather in the example)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not in the text, but rather in the example)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not in the text, but rather in the example)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is not in the text, but rather in the example)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is not in the text, but"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
