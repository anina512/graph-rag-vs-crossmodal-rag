Let cool slightly in pan, then pour into a small bowl. DO AHEAD: Caramel sauce can be made 2 weeks ahead. Let cool completely, cover, and chill. Rewarm before using.\nCombine half-and-half and cream in a medium saucepan. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat; remove from heat.\nWhisk egg yolks, eggs, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl to blend. Gradually whisk hot cream mixture into egg mixture. Cover custard with plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes for flavors to meld. Strain custard into a large bowl; discard vanilla bean.\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Butter cake pan; set aside. Using biscuit cutter, cut out circles from each slice of bread, reserving scraps. Arrange bread scraps in pan in an even layer and press lightly to compact.\nSpread each bread round with almond butter (you will have a little left over; save to spread on toast for breakfast). Place all but 1 bread round almond butter side down in pan (on top of scraps), overlapping slightly to create a shingled circle. Place the last round in the center (bread will come about 3/4\"-1\" above rim of pan).\nPour custard evenly over bread. Sprinkle with almonds and raw sugar.\nPlace cake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up the sides of cake pan. Cover roasting pan with foil, tenting slightly in center if needed to avoid touching bread.\nBake pudding until top no longer jiggles but center is not quite set, 25-30 minutes. Remove foil from pan and increase oven temperature to 375°F. Bake pudding until custard is set in the center and top is golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes longer.\nRemove cake pan from roasting pan. Let cool slightly. Dust pudding with powdered sugar. Slice into wedges. Place on plates, drizzle caramel sauce over and top with a dollop of crème fraîche.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL<|>EVENT<|>Caramel is a deep amber color after 5 minutes of cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is whisked into the mixture to create a sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Cream is whisked into the mixture to create a sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is added to the mixture to enhance flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALF-AND-HALF<|>EVENT<|>Half-and-half is combined with cream in a saucepan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEAN<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla bean is added to the mixture for flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>EVENT<|>Egg yolks are whisked with sugar and salt to create a custard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are whisked with sugar and salt to create a custard)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is added to the mixture to enhance flavor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE PAN<|>EVENT<|>Cake pan is preheated to 350°F)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BISCUIT CUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Biscuit cutter is used to cut out bread rounds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>EVENT<|>Bread is cut into rounds and arranged in a pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMOND BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Almond butter is spread on bread rounds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMONDS<|>EVENT<|>Almonds are sprinkled on top of the pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAW SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Raw sugar is sprinkled on top of the pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTING PAN<|>EVENT<|>Roasting pan is used to hold the cake pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOIL<|>EVENT<|>Foil is used to cover the roasting pan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is used to bake the pudding)\n##\n(\"entity"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
