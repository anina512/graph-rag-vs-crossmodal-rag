Preheat the oven to 325°F. Grease the sides and bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan with butter and coat lightly with flour.\n2. Melt the chocolate and the 8 tablespoons butter in a small bowl over a pot of barely simmering water. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the mixture is fluffy and pale yellow. Whisk in the espresso, cardamom, vanilla, and salt until well combined.\n3. Remove the melted chocolate and butter from the heat and stir with a rubber spatula. Then very slowly add the chocolate to the egg mixture and mix until thoroughly combined. Sift the 2/3 cup flour into the batter and mix well.\n4. Pour the brownie batter into the greased pan and use a rubber spatula to scrape out all that chocolate goodness. This is the part where I usually lick the spatula if no one is looking. Bake the brownies in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes. You can check for doneness by sticking a toothpick right in the middle. If it comes out clean, you're only seconds away from chocolate heaven. Cool the brownies before cutting.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TURKISH COFFEE BROWNIES<|>EVENT<|>Recipe for Turkish Coffee Brownies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TURKISH COFFEE BROWNIES<|>EVENT<|>Recipe for Turkish Coffee Brownies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ESPRESSO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Espresso is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CARDAMOM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cardamom is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is an ingredient in the recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is used to bake the brownies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking pan is used to bake the brownies)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RUBBER SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rubber spatula is used to mix the batter)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toothpick is used to check for doneness)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BUTTER<|>CHOCOLATE<|>Butter and chocolate are mixed together in the recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>SUGAR<|>Eggs and sugar are whisked together in the recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>ESPRESSO<|>CARD"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
