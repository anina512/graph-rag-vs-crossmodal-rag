Let the porcini mushrooms soak until tender, 10 to 15 minutes, then lift them from the liquid and squeeze any excess liquid into the bowl. Finely chop the porcini mushrooms. Reserve the porcini mushrooms and the liquid separately.\nIn a heavy 4-quart pot over moderately low heat, warm 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil. Add the onion and cook, covered and stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly golden, 10 to 15 minutes.\nAdd the amaranth and stir to coat it with the butter and oil. Slowly add the reserved porcini mushroom soaking liquid, leaving any grit at the bottom of the bowl. Add the 2 1/2 cups cold water, cover the pot, and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking occasionally. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, push any seeds clinging to the side of the pot into the liquid, then reduce the heat to low and continue to simmer, covered, until the liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Remove the pot from the heat and let the amaranth stand, covered, 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhile the amaranth is simmering, in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the remaining butter with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.
