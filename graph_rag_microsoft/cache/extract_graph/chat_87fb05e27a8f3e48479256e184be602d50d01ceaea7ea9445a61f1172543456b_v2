Add the leftover starter, milk, 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter, and egg into a large bowl. Whisk well to combine. Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt and continue to whisk until smooth. If the batter seems too thick, add more milk to thin out the texture. This will all depend on the consistency of your sourdough starter.\nLightly coat the waffle iron with cooking spray. Ladle some of the batter into the waffle iron to fill the pan. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Transfer to a cutting board and brush lightly with some of the remaining melted butter. Press the waffle into the cinnamon sugar to coat on both sides. Repeat to cook the rest of the waffles.\nTo serve, top your waffles with the pineapple, mixed berries, and coconut flakes. Enjoy with sweet maple syrup on the side.\nTIP: Once completely cool, these waffles can be frozen for up to 2 months. Cover in plastic wrap and a layer of foil before freezing. Bake frozen at 350°F (180°C) until warmed through.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_87fb05e27a8f3e48479256e184be602d50d01ceaea7ea9445a61f1172543456b_v2"}
