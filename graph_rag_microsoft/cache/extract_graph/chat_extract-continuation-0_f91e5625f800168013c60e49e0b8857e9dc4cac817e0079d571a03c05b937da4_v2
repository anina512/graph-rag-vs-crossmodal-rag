Set aside. Using a paring knife, cut ends off remaining lemon to expose flesh. Upend lemon on a cut end and remove peel and white pith from lemons; discard. Cut between membranes to release segments into bowl with juice; squeeze membranes to get any last drops of juice. Fish out any seeds; set aside. Thinly slice chives and place in a small bowl; set aside.\nPull side muscle off scallops, if needed; pat dry. Season lightly on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet, preferably stainless steel, over medium-high. Pour in oil to lightly coat surface (2–3 Tbsp.); heat until it shimmers and you see first wisps of smoke. Swiftly place scallops into skillet, flat side down, and cook without touching, tossing, or fussing until underside is deep golden brown, 3–4 minutes. Use a thin spatula or tongs to gently turn over; if they resist, cook another 30 seconds and try again. Cook on second side until flesh at top and bottom looks opaque but there is still a faintly translucent strip in the middle, 1–2 minutes, depending on size. Transfer scallops to a plate.\nPour off any oil in skillet and set over medium heat. Add butter and cook, swirling, until butter foams, then browns, about 2 minutes. Add reserved lemon juice and segments; energetically stir and swirl pan to emulsify sauce. Mix in capers and reserved chives and spoon pan sauce around and over scallops.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SEARED SCALLOPS<|>EVENT<|>Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce is a dish that combines scallops with brown butter and lemon pan sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Brown butter is a key component of the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON PAN SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Lemon pan sauce is a key component of the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLOPS<|>EVENT<|>Scallops are the main ingredient in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHIVES<|>EVENT<|>Chives are used as a garnish in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPERS<|>EVENT<|>Capers are used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Lemon is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>EVENT<|>Oil is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Freshly ground pepper is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Extra-virgin olive oil is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Vegetable oil is used in the Seared Scallops with Brown Butter and Lemon Pan Sauce dish)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
