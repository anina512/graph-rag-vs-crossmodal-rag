In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, whole eggs, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and fold in the wet just until moistened.\nCoat 8-inch skillet with some melted butter and heat over medium-low heat. Pour 1/2 cup of the batter into the pan and cook for 1 1/2 minutes, or until large bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake. Carefully flip the pancake over and cook for 1 minute longer, or until the underside is just cooked through. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter to make 6 pancakes and let cool to room temperature.\nIn a bowl, with and electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and yogurt until smooth. Beat in 4 tablespoons of the maple syrup and the confectioners' sugar until well combined.\nSpread each pancake with one-sixth of the filling (about 5 tablespoons). Place one of the pancakes on a platter and stack the remaining pancakes on top. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon maple syrup over the top of the cake.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PANCAKE CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Pancake Cake is a dessert made with pancakes and maple cream frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Maple Cream Frosting is a topping for Pancake Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Cream Cheese is an ingredient in the Maple Cream Frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEK YOGURT<|>EVENT<|>Greek Yogurt is an ingredient in the Maple Cream Frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>EVENT<|>Maple Syrup is an ingredient in the Maple Cream Frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Confectioners Sugar is an ingredient in the Maple Cream Frosting)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PANCAKE CAKE<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>Pancake Cake is topped with Maple Cream Frosting<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>CREAM CHEESE<|>Cream Cheese is an ingredient in Maple Cream Frosting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>GREEK YOGURT<|>Greek Yogurt is an ingredient in Maple Cream Frosting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>Maple Syrup is an ingredient in Maple Cream Frosting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAPLE CREAM FROSTING<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>Confectioners Sugar is an ingredient in Maple Cream Frosting<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
