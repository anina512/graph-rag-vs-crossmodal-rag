Combine 2/3 cup sugar and vanilla bean in processor; blend until vanilla bean is very finely minced. Sift vanilla sugar through strainer into large bowl; discard any large bits in strainer. Mix flour and cardamom into vanilla sugar. Add peaches to flour-sugar mixture and toss gently to coat.\nRoll out 1 pie crust disk on floured surface to 12-inch round. Transfer to 9-inch-diameter glass pie dish. Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch. Spoon peach mixture into crust; dot with butter. Roll out second pie crust disk on lightly floured surface to 12-inch round. Drape dough over peach filling; trim overhang to 1 1/2 inches. Fold top and bottom edges under, pressing together to seal. Crimp edges decoratively. Using small sharp knife, cut 2-inch-long X in center of top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush crust lightly with whipping cream; sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar.\nPlace pie on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until crust is golden, peaches are tender, and juices bubble thickly through cut in top crust, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool until lukewarm, about 2 hours.\nServe pie lukewarm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>EVENT<|>Summer Peach Pie is a dessert recipe that combines peaches, vanilla, and cardamom)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARDAMOM<|>EVENT<|>Cardamom is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACHES<|>EVENT<|>Peaches are the main fruit used in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIE CRUST<|>EVENT<|>Pie crust is a key component of the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHIPPING CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Whipping cream is used as a topping for the Summer Peach Pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla ice cream is served with the Summer Peach Pie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is used in the Summer Peach Pie recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>Vanilla is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARDAMOM<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>Cardamom is a key ingredient in the Summer Peach Pie recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEACHES<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>Peaches are the main fruit used in the Summer Peach Pie recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PIE CRUST<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>Pie crust is a key component of the Summer Peach Pie recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHIPPING CREAM<|>SUMMER PEACH PIE<|>Whipping cream is used as a topping for the Summer Peach Pie<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>SUMMER PEACH"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
