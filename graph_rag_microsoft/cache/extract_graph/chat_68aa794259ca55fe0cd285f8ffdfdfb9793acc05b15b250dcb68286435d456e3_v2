Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 5–8 minutes. Let cool, then finely chop. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F.\nSlice about 1/2\" off the top of each tomato; reserve tops. Using a spoon, scoop out the center of each tomato (save for making sauce). Season insides of tomatoes with salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking dish large enough to hold tomatoes (they can be snug).\nMix pistachios, garlic, raisins, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 Tbsp. thyme in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Place about 1 Tbsp. filling in each tomato. Tear mozzarella into bite-size pieces and snuggle into tomatoes. Top with remaining filling (you may need to gently press filling down with your fingers).\nReplace tomato tops; drizzle with oil. Scatter thyme sprigs over and bake, uncovered, until tomatoes release some liquid and begin to get a little wrinkly on top, 35–45 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_68aa794259ca55fe0cd285f8ffdfdfb9793acc05b15b250dcb68286435d456e3_v2"}
