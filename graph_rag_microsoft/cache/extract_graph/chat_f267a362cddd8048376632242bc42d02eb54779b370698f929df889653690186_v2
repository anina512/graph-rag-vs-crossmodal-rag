Clean and lightly oil grate. Rub tenderloin with 1/4 cup oil and sprinkle with peppercorns and kosher salt. Grill over hottest part of grill, turning often, until lightly charred on all sides, about 5 minutes. Move to cooler part and continue to grill, turning often, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 120°F for medium-rare, 25–30 minutes longer. Transfer to a platter and let cool.\nJust before serving, thinly slice tenderloin on a large cutting board you can also serve from (or transfer back to platter). Arrange tomato slices, cucumber slices, and basil alongside. Drizzle tomatoes and cucumbers very lightly with vinegar. Drizzle oil over everything and season liberally with sea salt and ground pepper. Serve with Lemony Yogurt Sauce and/or Grilled Serrano Salsa Verde alongside.\nBeef tenderloin can be grilled 1 day ahead. As soon as it is cool, wrap tightly in plastic (do not slice) and chill until ready to serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f267a362cddd8048376632242bc42d02eb54779b370698f929df889653690186_v2"}
