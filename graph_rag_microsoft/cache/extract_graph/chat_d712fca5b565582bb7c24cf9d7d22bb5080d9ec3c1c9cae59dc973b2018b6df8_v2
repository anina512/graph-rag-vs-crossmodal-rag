Using a sharp knife, score fat across the top of lamb shoulder to create a crosshatch pattern, cutting about 1/4\" deep and spacing cuts about 3/4\" apart. Season generously all over with salt and pepper.\nCombine grated garlic, oil, red pepper flakes, grated zest, and 2 Tbsp. rosemary in a small bowl. Rub all over lamb, working into score marks and anywhere there is an opening. Place lamb in a large cast-iron skillet or baking dish. (At this point the lamb can be covered and chilled up to 1 day if you want to break up the prep.)\nArrange garlic heads, cut side down, around lamb and add strip of zest. Pour in wine and cover tightly with foil. Roast until meat is falling off the bone and fork-tender, 5–5 1/2 hours. Keep covered and let rest 30 minutes.\nGently toss orange pieces and fennel with lemon juice in a medium bowl; season lightly with salt.\nTear the meat off the bones in large pieces and mound on a platter. Arrange citrus and fennel salad next to meat. Top meat with more rosemary and drizzle pan juices over.\nLamb can be roasted 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Gently reheat, covered, in a 300°F oven until warmed all the way through, at least 1 hour, before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d712fca5b565582bb7c24cf9d7d22bb5080d9ec3c1c9cae59dc973b2018b6df8_v2"}
