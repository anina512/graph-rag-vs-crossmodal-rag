Pour in cold water to cover by 1\" and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Remove from heat, cover pot, and let stand for 10 minutes. Transfer eggs to a medium bowl of ice water; let cool completely.\nIf desired, color eggs according to food-coloring package directions. Transfer eggs to paper towels to dry. DO AHEAD: Eggs can be dyed up to 1 week ahead. Cover and chill.\nLine a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch down dough. Divide into 3 equal pieces. With lightly floured hands, roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a 16\"- long rope with tapered ends. (If dough begins to bounce back, cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 minutes to allow dough to relax.)\nArrange ropes side by side lengthwise on prepared sheet. Pinch top ends together. Braid dough. Pinch bottom ends together to secure (braided loaf will be about 12\" long). Tuck dyed eggs between braids, spacing evenly. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm, draft-free area until puffed but not doubled in size, 45-50 minutes. Arrange a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Whisk remaining egg with 2 teaspoons warm water in a small bowl. Avoiding dyed eggs, brush dough all over with egg wash. Bake until bread is golden and an instantread thermometer inserted into center of loaf registers 190°F, 20-25 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Let cool completely and store airtight at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>EASTER BREAD (TSOUREKI)<|>EVENT<|>Easter Bread (Tsoureki) is a traditional Greek bread eaten during Easter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>PERSON<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASTER SWEET DOUGH<|>PERSON<|>Master Sweet Dough is a type of dough used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>PERSON<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD COLORING<|>PERSON<|>Food coloring is used to dye eggs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TSOUREKI<|>EVENT<|>Tsoureki is a traditional Greek bread eaten during Easter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WASH<|>PERSON<|>Egg wash is a mixture of egg and water used to brush dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>PERSON<|>Instant-read thermometer is a kitchen tool used to measure internal temperature of bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>PERSON<|>Wire rack is a kitchen tool used to cool bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>PERSON<|>Kitchen towel is a kitchen tool used to cover dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>PERSON<|>Parchment paper is a kitchen tool used to line baking sheet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGGS<|>EASTER BREAD (TSOUREKI)<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in Easter Bread (Tsoureki)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASTER SWEET DOUGH<|>EASTER BREAD (TSOUREKI)<|>Master Sweet Dough is used to make Easter Bread (Tsoureki)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EASTER BREAD (TSOUREKI)<|>All-purpose flour is used to make Easter Bread (Tsoureki)<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOOD COLORING<|>EASTER BREAD (TSOUREKI)<|>Food coloring is used to dye eggs for Easter Bread (Tsoureki)<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
