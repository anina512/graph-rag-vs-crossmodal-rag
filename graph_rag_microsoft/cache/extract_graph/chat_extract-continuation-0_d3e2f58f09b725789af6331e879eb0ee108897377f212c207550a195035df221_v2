Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in the butter and remove the pan from the heat. Whisk in the lemon juice, basil leaves, and the tomato julienne. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nRemove the lobster from the oven. Place a mound of Lemon Rice in the center of each of six plates. Place equal portions of the lobster over the rice. Spoon the sauce over the top of each mound and garnish with Fried Basil.\nServe immediately.\nHeat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and allow them to sweat their liquid for 4 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat for an additional 3 minutes. Stir in the rice and sauté it for 1 minute. Add the stock (or water), lemon juice, salt, and pepper.\nRaise the heat and bring the stock to a boil. Boil for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced to about 1 1/2 cups. Lower the heat and tightly cover the rice. (If you don't have a tight-fitting lid, cover the rice with aluminum foil.) Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the rice to steam for 15 minutes. Do not uncover the pan.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a library like spaCy to identify entities in the text. We'll use the entity types provided in the input (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n2. **Entity Description**: For each identified entity, extract a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities. We can use a combination of NLP techniques, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing, to extract relevant information.\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Identify pairs of entities that are clearly related to each other. We can use a combination of NLP techniques, such as dependency parsing and semantic role labeling, to extract relationships between entities.\n\n4. **Relationship Strength**: Assign a numeric score to each relationship indicating its strength. We can use a combination of NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling, to determine the strength of each relationship.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses spaCy and other libraries to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom nltk import ne_chunk\nfrom nltk import wordnet\nfrom nltk import download\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Download required NLTK data\ndownload('punkt')\ndownload('wordnet')\ndownload('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\ndownload('maxent_ne_chunker')\ndownload('stopwords')\n\n# Load spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n\n# Define entity types\nentity_types = ['ORGANIZATION', 'PERSON', 'GEO', 'EVENT']\n\n# Define function to extract entity description\ndef extract_entity_description(entity):\n    description = ''\n    for token in entity:\n        if token.pos_ == 'NOUN' or token.pos_ == 'PROPN':\n            description += token.text + ' '\n    return description.strip()\n\n# Define function to extract relationships\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(entities)):\n            if entities[i].ent_type_ == entities[j].ent_type"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
