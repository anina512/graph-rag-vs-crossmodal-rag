Add 1/4 of mushrooms and sprinkle with salt. Sauté mushrooms until tender and beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to medium bowl. Working in 3 more batches, repeat with 6 tablespoons butter, remaining mushrooms, and salt and pepper.\nBring 7 cups chicken broth to simmer in medium saucepan; keep warm. Melt remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add leek, sprinkle with salt, and sauté until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add rice and increase heat to medium. Stir until edges of rice begin to look translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add white wine and vermouth and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add 3/4 cup warm chicken broth; stir until almost all broth is absorbed, about 1 minute. Continue adding broth by 3/4 cupfuls, stirring until almost all broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is halfway cooked, about 10 minutes. Stir in sautéed mushrooms. Continue adding broth by 3/4 cupfuls, stirring until almost all broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is tender but still firm to bite and risotto is creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, if using. Transfer risotto to serving bowl. Pass additional Parmesan cheese alongside, if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO<|>EVENT<|>Wild Mushroom Risotto is a dish made with wild mushrooms, arborio rice, and Parmesan cheese)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wild mushrooms are a type of fungi used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ARBORIO RICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arborio rice is a type of rice used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN BROTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chicken broth is a liquid used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEEK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Leek is a type of vegetable used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White wine is a type of wine used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE VERMOUTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White vermouth is a type of fortified wine used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>WILD MUSHROOMS<|>ARBORIO RICE<|>Wild mushrooms and arborio rice are used together in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>ARBORIO RICE<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>Arborio rice and Parmesan cheese are used together in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>CHICKEN BROTH<|>Parmesan cheese and chicken broth are used together in the Wild Mushroom Risotto recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN BROTH"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
