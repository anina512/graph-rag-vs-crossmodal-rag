(or more) Sriracha', '1 lb. thick-cut bacon', '8 (1/2\"-thick) slices white sandwich or Pullman bread', '2 ripe medium beefsteak tomatoes, cut into thick slices', 'Flaky sea salt', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '1/2 head of iceberg lettuce, leaves separated']\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare a grill for medium heat. Stir together mayonnaise and Sriracha in a small bowl. Taste and add as much Sriracha as desired to meet your preferred level of spiciness.\nArrange bacon strips across grate and grill until lightly charred around the edges, 5–7 minutes. (Flare-ups are common, so lower the lid if needed and carefully raise just to check doneness.) Turn bacon over and grill until browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. Cooking times can vary significantly based on how thick your bacon is and the heat of your grill. (If you’re grilling bacon for the first time, keep a close eye on it and check often.) Transfer bacon to paper towels to drain.\nArrange bread on grate and grill until toasted, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a cutting board.\nSpread Sriracha mayonnaise over 1 side of each slice of bread. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper, then build sandwiches with lettuce on the bottom, tomatoes in the middle, and bacon on top (tear lettuce leaves and cut bacon in half to fit nicely if needed). Close up sandwiches and slice in half on a diagonal.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GRILLED BACON BLTS<|>EVENT<|>Grilled Bacon BLTs is a recipe for a sandwich)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BACON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bacon is a type of meat used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mayonnaise is a condiment used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SRIRACHA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sriracha is a condiment used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE SANDWICH BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White sandwich bread is a type of bread used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULLMAN BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pullman bread is a type of bread used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEEFSTEAK TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Beefsteak tomatoes are a type of tomato used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICEBERG LETTUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Iceberg lettuce is a type of lettuce used in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A grill is a cooking device used to make the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACON<|>MAYONNAISE<|>Bacon and mayonnaise are used together in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACON<|>SRIRACHA<|>Bacon and Sriracha are used together in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAYONNAISE<|>SRIRACHA<|>Mayonnaise and Sriracha are mixed together in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACON<|>WHITE SANDWICH BREAD<|>Bacon is used on top of white sandwich bread in the Grilled Bacon BLTs recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BACON<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
