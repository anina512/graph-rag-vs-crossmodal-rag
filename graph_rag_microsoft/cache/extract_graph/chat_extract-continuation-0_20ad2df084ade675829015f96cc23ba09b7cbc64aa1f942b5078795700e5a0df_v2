Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Stir with a fork or the dough hook to make a shaggy dough. If making the dough by hand, stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to work the gluten for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth. Then turn onto a lightly floured countertop and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, adding small sprinkles of flour as needed to just keep it from sticking. If you're using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, beat on high speed until the dough comes together and slaps the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes, adding up to 1/4 cup/30 grams more flour as needed to create a cohesive ball.\nDivide the dough half\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Code\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    entities = defaultdict(dict)\n    for entity_type in entity_types:\n        if entity_type == 'organization':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'person':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'geo':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        elif entity_type == 'event':\n            pattern = r'\\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b'\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid entity type: {entity_type}\")\n        \n        matches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n        for match in matches:\n            entity_name = match.capitalize()\n            entity_description = f\"{entity_name} is a {entity_type}\"\n            entities[entity_type][entity_name] = entity_description\n    \n    return entities\n\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for entity_name in entities[entity_type]:\n            for other_entity_type in entities:\n                for other_entity_name in entities[other_entity_type]:\n                    if entity_name != other_entity_name:\n                        relationship_description = f\"{entity_name} and {other_entity_name} are related\"\n                        relationship_strength = 1\n                        relationships.append((entity_name, other_entity_name, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    \n    return relationships\n\ndef format_output(entities, relationships):\n    output = []\n    for entity_type in entities:\n        for entity_name in entities[entity_type]:\n            entity_description = entities[entity_type][entity_name]\n            output.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description}')\")\n    \n    for relationship in relationships:\n        source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength = relationship\n        output.append(f\"('relationship'<|>{source_entity}<|>{target_entity}<|>{relationship_description}<|>{relationship_strength}')\")\n    \n    return output\n\ndef main():\n    entity_types = ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\n    text = \"\"\"\nGardener's Pizza\n\nIngredients:\n['Generous pinch of sugar', '1 1/4 cups/300 ml warm water {about 110"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
