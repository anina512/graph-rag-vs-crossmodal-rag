Transfer to a small bowl; stir in cilantro. Cover and chill 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, trim fish to create clean edges. Holding your knife at a 45° angle, slice into 1/4\"-thick pieces; try for one fluid movement per slice to avoid shredding flesh. Transfer to a plate as you go, separating layers with sheets of plastic wrap as needed. Chill until ready to serve.\nStrain purée through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing down on solids to extract as much liquid as possible (you should have about 1/2 cup; this is your \"leche de tigre\"). Stir in passion fruit juice and lime juice, adding a bit more lime juice to balance acidity if needed.\nArrange fish and tomatoes in shallow bowls; spoon leche de tigre over. Season with salt and top with sliced onion and microgreens.
