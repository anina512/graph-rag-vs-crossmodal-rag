Stack remaining 2 mini pans and fill with 1 cup drained wood chips. Place pans on flame. If using charcoal, scatter 2 cups drained chips over coals. Brush top grill rack with oil; return to barbecue.\nPlace ribs on grill rack over drip pan. Cover barbecue; grill until meat is coming away from bones, turning and repositioning every 30 minutes and adding more wood chips to pans as needed, about 1 1/2 hours. Maintain barbecue temperature at 350°F, opening vents wider for more heat or partially closing for less heat. Transfer ribs to rimmed baking sheet; cool.\nDO AHEAD: Ribs can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Remove drip pan from barbecue.\nLightly brush grill racks with oil. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Sprinkle chicken with salt and remaining spice rub. Place chicken, sausages, and ribs on grill racks; cover and grill 7 minutes, turning occasionally. Brush ribs with 1 cup cherry cola sauce; cover and grill until chicken is cooked through and ribs are glazed, turning frequently, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer sausages to platter; transfer ribs and chicken to cutting board. Cut pork between bones; cut chicken crosswise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Transfer to platter with sausages. Serve with remaining cherry cola sauce.\n* Hot smoked Spanish paprika is available at specialty foods stores and from tienda.com; smoked paprika is now available in the spice section of some supermarkets.\nSurprisingly, an offdry Riesling is excellent with the sweet and spicy flavors in this menu. We like the 2006 Riesling ($14) from Koehler Winery in California's Santa Ynez Valley. Its citrus and green apple flavors are a nice foil for the smoky chiles here. For a more classic pairing, go for beer: Try a hoppy, malty IPA (India Pale Ale), like Northern California's Lagunitas IPA ($9 for a six-pack).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BARBECUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Barbecue is a method of cooking food over low heat, often using wood chips to add smoky flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOEHLER WINERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Koehler Winery is a California winery that produces a 2006 Riesling)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LAGUNITAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lagunitas is a Northern California brewery that produces a hoppy IPA)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TIENDA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tienda is a company that sells specialty foods, including hot smoked Spanish paprika)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SANTA YNEZ VALLEY<|>GEO<|>Santa Ynez Valley is a region in California known for its wine production)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA<|>GEO<|>California is a state in the US where the barbecue and wine are produced)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPAIN<|>GEO<|>Spain is the country of origin for the hot smoked Spanish paprika)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RIBS<|>EVENT<|>Ribs are a type of food being cooked in the barbecue)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Chicken is a type of food being cooked in the barbecue)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAUSAGES<|>EVENT<|>Sausages are a type of food being cooked in the barbecue)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BARBECUE<|>KOEHLER WINERY<|>Barbecue and Koehler Winery are related because the winery's Riesling is recommended to pair with the barbecue's smoky flavors<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BARBECUE<|>LAGUNITAS<|>Barbecue and Lagunitas are related because the brewery's IPA is recommended to pair with the barbecue's smoky flavors<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BARBECUE<|>TIENDA<|>Barbecue and Tienda are related because Tienda sells the hot smoked Spanish paprika used in the barbecue<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>RIBS<|>BARBECUE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
