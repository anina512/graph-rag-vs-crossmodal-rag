Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef entity_recognizer(doc):\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        ents.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"My Never-Ever-Fail Chocolate Fudge\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['12 oz bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped', '2 cups toasted walnut, pecan, macadamia, or other nuts, chopped, optional', '10 tbsps unsalted butter, at room temperature', '1 tbsp pure vanilla extract', '20 large marshmallows', '4 cups sugar', '2 5-oz cans evaporated milk']\\n\\nInstructions:\\nCombine the chocolate pieces, nuts (if using), butter, and vanilla in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside.\\nPlace the marshmallows, sugar, and evaporated milk in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Continuing to stir, boil for exactly 6 minutes.\\nRemove from the heat and immediately pour the marshmallow mixture into the chocolate mixture; beat constantly until creamy. Quickly pour into the prepared pan or platter, pushing slightly with the back of a wooden spoon to spread the fudge evenly.\\nCool for at least 1 hour before cutting into pieces.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
