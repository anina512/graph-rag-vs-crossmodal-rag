Whisk flour, cornstarch, 1 teaspoon coarse salt, baking powder, and cayenne pepper in medium bowl to blend. Working in batches, toss squid rings in flour mixture to coat, then place rings in single layer on sheet of foil.\nPour both oils into large skillet; lean deep-fry thermometer on side of skillet, submerging bulb in oil. Heat oil over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 350° to 360°. Working in several batches, add squid rings to hot oil and cook until light golden and crisp around edges, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer squid to paper- towel-lined baking sheet to drain.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot. Add butter and 3 tablespoons lemon juice and toss to coat pasta. Add 3/4 cup pasta cooking liquid and toss. Mix in 1/3 cup parsley. Season to taste with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper, adding more lemon juice and pasta cooking liquid, if desired.\nTransfer pasta to large bowl; top with calamari. Sprinkle with remaining parsley. Serve with lemon wedges.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>AMALFI CALAMARI PASTA<|>EVENT<|>Amalfi Calamari Pasta is a recipe for a dish that combines squid and pasta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Squid is a type of seafood used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pasta is a type of food used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of fruit used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of oil used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANOLA OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canola oil is a type of oil used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPAGHETTI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spaghetti is a type of pasta used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN PARSLEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Italian parsley is a type of herb used in the Amalfi Calamari Pasta recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Krohaara is not mentioned"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
