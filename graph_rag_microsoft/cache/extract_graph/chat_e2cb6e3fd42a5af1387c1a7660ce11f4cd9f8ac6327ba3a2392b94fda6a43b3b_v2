Add the ham, cut-side up, as well as the parsnips and carrots. Pour the maple syrup and apple juice over the ham, and sprinkle the brown sugar over the top. Cook on high, uncovered, for 30 to 45 minutes, then cover the slow cooker and cook on low until the ham is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Hams vary in size and tenderness, so be patient. When it’s tender, the meat should come off the bone with very little resistance. Taste a small piece for tenderness.\nTransfer the ham and vegetables to a deep serving platter (reserve the liquid in the pot). Use a pair of kitchen shears or scissors to cut the slices of ham off the bone and let them fall onto the platter. Stir both kinds of mustard and the vinegar into the cooking liquid left in the slow cooker and taste for seasoning—the sauce may or may not need salt. Pour the liquid over the ham and vegetables, and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e2cb6e3fd42a5af1387c1a7660ce11f4cd9f8ac6327ba3a2392b94fda6a43b3b_v2"}
