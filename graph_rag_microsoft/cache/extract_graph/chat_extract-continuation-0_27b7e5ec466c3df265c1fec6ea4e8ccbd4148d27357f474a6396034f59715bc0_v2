Dry the garlic on a towel, then slice it as thinly as possible. Melt the butter with the olive oil, add the garlic, cover with a cartouche, and cook over low heat until translucent. Transfer to a large pot and add the milk and salt. Increase the heat to medium-high and slowly add the chickpea flour while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook over high heat until the mixture begins pulling away from the sides of the pan and the starchy flavor has cooked out. Pour the dough onto the prepared pan and spread evenly. Zest the lemon over the entire surface. Place plastic wrap directly on top of the panisse to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for about 1 hour, until completely set. Cut into desired shapes.\nHeat the grapeseed oil to 350°F (175°C) and fry the panisse pieces in small batches for about 30 seconds, until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels, arrange on a platter, and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>EVENT<|>Green Garlic Panisse is a dish made with green garlic, butter, olive oil, milk, salt, chickpea flour, and lemon)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Green garlic is a key ingredient in Green Garlic Panisse)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>EVENT<|>Whole milk is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add moisture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKPEA FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Chickpea flour is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add texture)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEYER LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Meyer lemon is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRAPSEED OIL<|>EVENT<|>Grapeseed oil is used in Green Garlic Panisse to deep fry the panisse)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>GREEN GARLIC<|>Green garlic is a key ingredient in Green Garlic Panisse<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>BUTTER<|>Butter is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>OLIVE OIL<|>Olive oil is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>WHOLE MILK<|>Whole milk is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add moisture<|>9)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN GARLIC PANISSE<|>KOSHER SALT<|>Kosher salt is used in Green Garlic Panisse to add flavor<|>9"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
