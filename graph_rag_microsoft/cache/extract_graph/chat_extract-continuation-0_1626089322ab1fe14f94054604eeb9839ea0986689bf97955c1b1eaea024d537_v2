Mix well. Coat each side of the tofu pieces with the arrowroot, shake off any excess arrowroot, and transfer them to a second large plate.\nLightly coat the bottom of a large cast-iron skillet with peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the tofu and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip each piece with a spatula and fry until golden brown on the second side. Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.\nOn a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves. Smear 2 heaping tablespoons of the reserved marinade on top of the tofu, sprinkle a heaping teaspoon of garlic chips on top of the tofu, then fold the leaves around the tofu to create a packet. Repeat with the remaining collard leaves and tofu.\nIn the same skillet, warm 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat, tilting the pan to coat it evenly with the oil. Place the packets in the skillet, folded-side up, and cook for about 1 minute. Gently flip each packet with a spatula, cover the skillet with a lid or some aluminum foil, and cook for about 5 minutes to warm through.\nTo serve, spread some cilantro sauce over four plates and place two of the tofu packets on each plate. Garnish with cilantro leaves and peanuts and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>TOFU<|>PERSON<|>Tofu is a food made from soybeans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARROWROOT<|>PERSON<|>Arrowroot is a type of starch used as a coating for tofu)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>GEO<|>Cast-iron skillet is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEANUT OIL<|>GEO<|>Peanut oil is a type of cooking oil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLARD LEAVES<|>GEO<|>Collard leaves are a type of leaf used as a wrapping material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CILANTRO SAUCE<|>GEO<|>Cilantro sauce is a type of condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEANUTS<|>GEO<|>Peanuts are a type of nut used as a garnish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOFU PACKETS<|>GEO<|>Tofu packets are a type of food package)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>GEO<|>Aluminum foil is a type of wrapping material)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>ARROWROOT<|>Tofu is coated with arrowroot<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>Tofu is cooked in a cast-iron skillet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>PEANUT OIL<|>Tofu is cooked with peanut oil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>COLLARD LEAVES<|>Tofu is wrapped in collard leaves<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>CILANTRO SAUCE<|>Tofu is served with cilantro sauce<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU<|>PEANUTS<|>Tofu is garnished with peanuts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOFU PACKETS<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>Tofu packets are wrapped in aluminum foil<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
