Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk egg white in bowl until frothy, about 1 minute. Whisk in sugar and cinnamon. Fold in nuts. Spread mixture on prepared sheet. Bake until beginning to dry, about 12 minutes. Using metal spatula, stir to break up nuts. Continue to bake until nuts and coating are dry and golden brown, about 10 minutes; cool on sheet. Transfer streusel to work surface. Chop nuts into small (rice-size) bits. Transfer to shallow bowl.\nWhisk first 5 ingredients in medium bowl to blend. Using electric mixer, beat sugar and eggs in large bowl until very thick, about 3 minutes. Beat in orange peel and vanilla. Gradually beat in butter; beat in sour cream in 2 additions. Gently fold in dry ingredients in 4 additions (dough will be slightly sticky). Cover; set aside 1 hour.\nCombine powdered sugar and maple extract in medium bowl. Add 4 tablespoons cream; whisk until smooth. Whisk in additional cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, to form medium-thick glaze. Cover and let stand up to 3 hours.\nSprinkle 2 rimmed baking sheets lightly with flour. Press out 1/3 of dough on lightly floured surface to 1/2- to 2/3-inch thickness. Using 2 1/2-inch-diameter round cutter, cut out dough rounds. Arrange on floured sheets. Repeat with remaining dough in 2 more batches.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\ndef custom_entity_recognizer(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Define the entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\"},\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n    \n    # Add the patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n    \n    # Process the document\n    doc = nlp(doc)\n    \n    # Find the entities\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        ents.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n    \n    # Return the entities\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Maple-Glazed Sour Cream Doughnuts with Sugared-Walnut Streusel\"\nents = custom_entity_recognizer(text)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor ent in ents:\n    print(f\"({ent[0]}<|>{ent[0].capitalize()}<|>{ent[1]}<|>Description of {ent[0]})\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all relationships among the entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform dependency parsing on the text.
