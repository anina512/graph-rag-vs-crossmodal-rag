Spoon in the honey and coconut oil, sprinkle the cinnamon, secure the lid and close off the pressure valve. Press the Steam button; the display will read 10 minutes. Allow the fruit to cook, and quick-release the pressure once the cooking cycle has completed. Remove the lid once safe to do so and transfer the cooked fruit with a slotted spoon or skimmer into a serving bowl. Now place the coconut, pecans, and sunflower seeds into the residual liquid and press the Sauté button. Allow the contents to cook, shifting them regularly so they do not burn. Once they are nicely browned and toasted, about 5 minutes or so, remove them and top your cooked fruit. Serve warm and topped with coconut whipped cream if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant Pot is a brand of electric pressure cooker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT POT BREAKFAST COBBLER<|>EVENT<|>Instant Pot Breakfast Cobbler is a recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAR<|>GEO<|>Pear is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>GEO<|>Apple is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLUM<|>GEO<|>Plum is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL HONEY<|>GEO<|>Local honey is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>GEO<|>Coconut oil is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND CINNAMON<|>GEO<|>Ground cinnamon is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSWEETENED SHREDDED COCONUT<|>GEO<|>Unsweetened shredded coconut is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECAN PIECES<|>GEO<|>Pecan pieces are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUNFLOWER SEEDS<|>GEO<|>Sunflower seeds are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT WHIPPED CREAM<|>GEO<|>Coconut whipped cream is a type of topping used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is the author of the recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INSTANT POT<|>INSTANT POT BREAKFAST COBBLER<|>Instant Pot Breakfast Cobbler is a recipe that uses an Instant Pot<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEAR<|>APPLE<|>Pear and Apple are types of fruit used in the recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEAR<|>PLUM<|>Pear and Plum are types of fruit used in the recipe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
