The level of liquid will reduce as the beans cook; once it gets to the point where it does not completely cover the beans, you will need to stir more often to ensure that the beans cook evenly.

If they are still hard, add more dashi or water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until the beans are tender with a little bite.\nAdd the sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds to the pot and mix well. (It’s important to wait to add the sugar until the beans are tender, as adding it in the beginning will cause the beans to harden when refrigerated.) Let the beans cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled.
