We will use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition and the NLTK library to perform tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.\n\nHere is a Python code that implements the solution:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"organization\", \"person\", \"geo\", \"event\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nChicken Peppersoup\n\nIngredients:\n['1 tablespoon anise seeds', '1 tablespoon coriander seeds', '1 tablespoon cumin seeds', '1 tablespoon allspice berries', '1 tablespoon ground ginger', '1 tablespoon fennel seeds', '1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns', '1 tablespoon dried tamarind pulp', '1 teaspoon whole cloves', '1 (3-pound) chicken, cut into serving pieces', '1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice', '4 cups water', '1 onion, minced', '2 cloves garlic, minced', '2 tablespoons dried bird chiles, or to taste', 'Salt, to taste', '4 cups chicken stock', '1/4 cup Pepper Soup Spice Mixture', '2 tablespoons minced dried smoked shrimp', '2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint', 'Mint sprigs, for garnish']\n\nInstructions:\nMix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Place them in a spice mill and pulse until they are pulverized. Spoon the peppersoup spice mixture into a clean glass jar and cover tightly.
