Your cassava root should be firm and white, not gray or mushy. That is a sign of spoilage.\nUsing the peeler or a mandolin, shave off thin strips of cassava about 1 1/4 inches wide to resemble strip bacon.\nMarinate the strips for 15 minutes.\nHeat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat with a small amount of oil. When the pan is hot, place 4 or 5 strips into the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side and 2 to 3 minutes after flipped. You may need to lower the heat so the pan doesn’t get too hot and burn the bacon. Once or twice while frying a batch, add a little bit of the excess marinade to help caramelize the bacon. Also add more oil to the pan before frying each batch.\nRemove the fried strips from the pan and set on a plate. Placing the strips on paper towels isn't advised, as they will stick.\nThe bacon lasts up to 2 weeks stored in an airtight container at room temperature or in the fridge. Warm up leftover strips in the oven or in a pan on the stove before serving with recipes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_480ea11fc0d388bdce7bc14b395c6598a0d35e55ccde80a0fd6281a7fa78e0d6_v2"}
