Holding an end in each hand, cross ends, then fold them down toward you to create a pretzel shape about 11\" wide. Return to rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Roll remaining 2 pieces to form 2 more (36\"-long) ropes. Twist ropes tightly around each other to make a twisted rope about 35\" long. Add to baking sheet with pretzel shape and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20–30 minutes.\nIf dough has settled into skillet, stretch dough to come back up just to outside rim. Using a fork, evenly prick bottom of dough in pan. Brush dough all over with baking soda mixture, if using. Beat egg yolk with 1 Tbsp. water in a small bowl, then brush dough with egg wash. Cover only outer rim of dough with foil. Bake dough in skillet until light golden brown and dry, 12–15 minutes. Let cool slightly, at least 5 minutes.\nBrush just outside rim of crust with egg wash and attach twisted dough rope to create a decorative rim. Fill crust with apple mixture. Center pretzel shape over apple filling, stretching dough until edges of pretzel reach twisted outside rim. Brush twisted dough rope and top of pretzel shape with baking soda mixture, if using, then egg wash. Sprinkle with pretzel salt.\nBake pie until pretzel is golden brown and firm to the touch, 12–15 minutes. If underside of dough seems underbaked, loosely cover top with foil and continue to bake, checking every 2 minutes, until cooked through. Let cool completely before slicing, at least 2 hours.\nPretzel dough can be made 1 day ahead. Let come to room temperature, then let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours. Apple pie filling can be made 2 days ahead. Store in a resealable container and chill. Bring to room temperature before baking. Baking soda solution can be made 3 days ahead. Store in a resealable container at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rope is a type of material used in baking pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking sheet is a kitchen tool used to bake pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is a kitchen tool used to cover pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Skillet is a kitchen tool used to bake pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg yolk is a kitchen ingredient used to make egg wash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda is a kitchen ingredient used to make baking soda mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WASH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg wash is a kitchen mixture used to brush pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda mixture is a kitchen mixture used to brush pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETZEL SHAPE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pretzel shape is a type of pretzel used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE PIE FILLING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple pie filling is a kitchen ingredient used to fill pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a kitchen ingredient used to make apple pie filling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETZEL SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pretzel salt is a kitchen ingredient used to sprinkle on pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOM TEMPERATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Room temperature is a condition used to let dough rise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM PLACE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warm place is a condition used to let dough rise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is a person who baked pretzels)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
