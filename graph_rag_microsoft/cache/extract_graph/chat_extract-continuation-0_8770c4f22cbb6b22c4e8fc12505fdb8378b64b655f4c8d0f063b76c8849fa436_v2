In a medium saucepan, bring 2 inches of water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and set bowl over pan. (Bottom of bowl should sit above the water without touching it.) Cook egg mixture, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 20 minutes. Whisk in gelatin until fully dissolved. Remove bowl from heat; pour curd evenly among four 5-ounce serving glasses; refrigerate until solid, about 2 hours. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, cook berries with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, stirring occasionally, until berries break down, liquefy and start to bubble, about 10 minutes. In a bowl, strain one third of hot berry mixture; add cornstarch and whisk until fully dissolved. Pour juice-cornstarch mixture into same saucepan; cook over medium-high heat until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chopped mint; let cool completely. Spoon berry sauce evenly over curd. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24; remove from fridge 30 minutes before serving; garnish with mint sprigs.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>EVENT<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>EVENT<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>EVENT<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>PERSON<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>PERSON<|>Orange juice is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>PERSON<|>Orange zest is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Sugar is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GELATIN<|>PERSON<|>Gelatin is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIXED BERRIES<|>PERSON<|>Mixed berries are a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>PERSON<|>Cornstarch is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH MINT<|>PERSON<|>Fresh mint is a common ingredient in many recipes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>GEO<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>GEO<|>Berry-Citrus Trifle is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRY-CITRUS TRIFLE<|>GEO<|>Berry"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
