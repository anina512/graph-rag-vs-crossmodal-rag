Peel eggs, then slice each crosswise into 5 pieces.\nMeanwhile, mix yogurt, lemon juice, and garlic in a small bowl; season yogurt sauce with salt.\nHeat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage and press down on it with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula to flatten; cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 4 minutes. Turn sausage over; break into smaller pieces with spoon. Cook until cooked through and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer sausage along with drippings to a medium bowl. Reserve skillet.\nLay out lavash on a work surface. Spread 1/4 cup yogurt sauce over each, leaving a 1\" border. Top with sausage, dividing evenly. Top each with 10 egg slices in a single layer, then with red onion, pickles, and mint. Fold in 2 sides of lavash and, starting at an unfolded edge, roll up tightly.\nSet reserved skillet over medium heat and cook 2 wraps, undisturbed, until golden brown and starting to crisp underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden brown and starting to crisp on the other side. Transfer to a cutting board. Repeat with remaining wraps.
