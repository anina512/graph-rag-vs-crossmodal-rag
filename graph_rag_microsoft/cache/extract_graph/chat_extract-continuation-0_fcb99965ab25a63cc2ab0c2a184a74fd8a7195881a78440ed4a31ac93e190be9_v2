Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a function to extract the entity information and format it as required.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    # Process the text\n    doc = nlp(text)\n\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the entities\n    entities = []\n\n    # Iterate over the entities in the document\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        # Check if the entity type is in the list of entity types\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            # Extract the entity information\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n\n            # Format the entity as required\n            entity = f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}<{entity_type}<{entity_description}>\"\n\n            # Add the entity to the list\n            entities.append(entity)\n\n    # Return the list of entities\n    return entities\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Orange Cinnamon Sweet Rolls\"\n\n# Extract the entities\nentities = extract_entities(text, entity_types)\n\n# Print the entities\nprint(\"##\".join(entities))\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll define a function to extract the relationships between the entities.
