Place 3/4 cup (160 g) cold water in the bowl of a stand mixer; sprinkle with yeast and let sit until creamy, about 5 minutes.\nMeanwhile, whisk potato flour and 3 1/2 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour in a medium bowl to remove lumps. Add flours and buttermilk to yeast mixture and mix on low speed with dough hook, increasing speed to medium as dough stiffens and comes together, about 5 minutes.\nTurn out dough onto a clean surface and knead until a smooth ball forms. Transfer to a large bowl and let sit 15 minutes to relax.\nPull apart dough into several pieces and return to stand-mixer bowl. Add vinegar and salt and mix on low speed with dough hook until dough is smooth, stretchy, and no longer sticky, 5–8 minutes.\nWith motor running, add butter 2 pieces at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as needed and mixing until incorporated before adding more, about 4 minutes between additions. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough starts to come away from sides of bowl and forms a ball, about 5 minutes longer.\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes to relax.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Stretch an edge up and over to the opposite side of dough. Repeat 3 times, working your way around dough. Flip dough over, return to bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until doubled in size, 18–24 hours.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat out larger air bubbles with floured hands.
