Set aside for 2 hours.\nIn a large saucepan, combine mango mixture and coconut milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until mangoes are softened.\nHave a splash guard and measured spices nearby. Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Immediately reduce heat to medium. (You can test the heat of the oil by dropping in a couple of seeds. The oil is at the correct temperature when the seeds crackle, but do not burn.) Add mustard seeds and temper for a few seconds, until they stop popping. (Cover with the splash guard, if needed.) Add red chiles and curry leaves and cook for 15–20 seconds. Add the tempered spice mixture to the saucepan and stir to combine.\nGarnish with fried onions (if using). Serve with rice.\nTempering is a traditional method of extracting optimal flavor from Indian spices, and it is a skill learned with practice! Reducing the heat a little before adding the spices prevents the spices from burning and adding a bitterness to your dish. If they do burn, simply start again with fresh spices.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MANGO CURRY<|>EVENT<|>Mango Curry is a traditional Indian dish that combines mangoes with spices and coconut milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREEN MANGO<|>PERSON<|>Green mango is a type of mango that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>PERSON<|>Shallots are a type of onion that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIAN GREEN CHILES<|>PERSON<|>Indian green chiles are a type of pepper that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is a type of root that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a type of bulb that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT VINEGAR<|>PERSON<|>Coconut vinegar is a type of vinegar that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a type of seasoning that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT MILK<|>PERSON<|>Coconut milk is a type of milk that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>PERSON<|>Coconut oil is a type of oil that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK MUSTARD SEEDS<|>PERSON<|>Black mustard seeds are a type of spice that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED RED CHILES<|>PERSON<|>Dried red chiles are a type of pepper that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRY LEAVES<|>PERSON<|>Curry leaves are a type of leaf that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIED ONIONS<|>PERSON<|>Fried onions are a type of garnish that is often used in Indian cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASMATI RICE<|>PERSON<|>Basmati rice is a type of rice that is often served with Indian dishes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREEN MANGO"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
