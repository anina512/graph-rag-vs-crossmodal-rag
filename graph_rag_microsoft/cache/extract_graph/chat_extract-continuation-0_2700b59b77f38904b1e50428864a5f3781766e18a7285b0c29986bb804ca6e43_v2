Transfer walnut mixture to a medium bowl.\nCombine granulated sugar, remaining ¼ cup brown sugar, and remaining 8 Tbsp. butter in food processor (no need to wash it) and process in long pulses until mixture is light and smooth. Add eggs and vanilla and process in long pulses, scraping down sides of processor once, until mixture is smooth. Add half of walnut mixture and pulse to combine, then add yogurt and pulse just until incorporated. Add remaining walnut mixture and pulse just to combine.\nArrange apple halves cut sides down over cooled caramel in skillet, spacing evenly. Fold batter a few times with spatula, scraping sides to make sure everything is well mixed. Scrape batter over apples and work into spaces around apples. Smooth surface (it’s okay if there’s only a thin layer of batter in places; it will rise in the oven).\nBake cake until it is browned across the entire surface and the center springs back when gently pressed, 30–40 minutes. Let cake cool in skillet 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or a small knife around the sides of the pan to loosen. Set a wire rack upside down on skillet and flip over to release cake; carefully remove skillet. If any apples or cake stick to skillet, scrape them off and press back onto the top of the cake.\nServe cake warm or room temperature. Slice into wedges and top with dollops of whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon.\nDo Ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Let cool completely. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL COOL<|>EVENT<|>Caramel cool is a cooking event where a cake is baked in a skillet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>The skillet is a cooking vessel where the cake is baked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALNUTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walnuts are a type of nut used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of baking ingredient used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda is a type of baking ingredient used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a type of baking ingredient used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUTMEG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nutmeg is a type of spice used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cinnamon is a type of spice used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla is a type of flavoring used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOGURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yogurt is a type of ingredient used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Granulated sugar is a type of sugar used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brown sugar is a type of sugar used in the cake recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of ingredient"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
