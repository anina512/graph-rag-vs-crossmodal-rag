Reserve remaining ground tea.\nUsing a large spoon, divide meringue into 6 even mounds on the prepared baking sheet. Using the back of the spoon, make a small well in the center of each meringue. Lightly dust 1 tsp. reserved ground tea with fine-mesh strainer over meringues. Reserve remaining ground tea.\nBake, rotating halfway through cooking time, until outsides are dry and a very pale cream color, 65–70 minutes. Turn oven off and leave door slightly ajar with meringues inside, letting them cool completely, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.\nBring 1 cup water to a boil in a small pot. Remove from heat and steep dried hibiscus flowers or tea bags, 4–5 minutes. Strain tea or discard tea bags; if straining, strain into a medium bowl, then return tea to pot. Add sugar and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the liquid, stirring occasionally, until a scant 1/4 cup liquid is left, 8–11 minutes—it should be thick with a syrupy consistency. Transfer to a small bowl and chill until cold, about 20 minutes.\nUsing an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat cream on medium-low speed in a large bowl until very soft peaks form. Reduce speed to low and gently beat in lemon curd, sour cream, and salt. If necessary, continue whipping until soft peaks return. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. chilled hibiscus syrup over whipped cream. Using a spatula, marble syrup throughout cream, creating dark pink streaks rather than a solid pink cream.\nDivide meringues among 6 dessert plates, then top each with a dollop of lemon-hibiscus cream. Using a fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust top of each pavlova with 1 tsp. reserved ground tea total, if desired, and serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH STRAINER<|>OBJECT<|>A kitchen tool used to sift and strain ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MERINGUE<|>OBJECT<|>A type of dessert made from whipped egg whites and sugar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>OBJECT<|>A flat, rectangular pan used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>OBJECT<|>A kitchen tool used to scrape and mix ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINE-MESH STRAINER<|>OBJECT<|>A kitchen tool used to sift and strain ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA<|>OBJECT<|>A type of beverage made from dried leaves)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON CURD<|>OBJECT<|>A type of dessert made from lemon juice, sugar, and eggs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUR CREAM<|>OBJECT<|>A type of dairy product made from cream and lactic acid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON-HIBISCUS CREAM<|>OBJECT<|>A type of dessert made from whipped cream, lemon curd, and hibiscus syrup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAVLOVA<|>OBJECT<|>A type of dessert made from meringue, whipped cream, and fruit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIBISCUS SYRUP<|>OBJECT<|>A type of sweetener made from hibiscus flowers and sugar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIED HIBISCUS FLOWERS<|>OBJECT<|>A type of ingredient used to make hibiscus syrup)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA BAGS<|>OBJECT<|>A type of packaging used to hold loose-leaf tea)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL POT<|>OBJECT<|>A type of cooking vessel used to boil water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM BOWL<|>OBJECT<|>A type of kitchen container used to mix and serve ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>OBJECT<|>A type of kitchen appliance used to mix and whip ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHISK ATTACHMENT<|>OBJECT<|>A type of kitchen tool used to mix and whip ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE BOWL<|>OBJECT<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
