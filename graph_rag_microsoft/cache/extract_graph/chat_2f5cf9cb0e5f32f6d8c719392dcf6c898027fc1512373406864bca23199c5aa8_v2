Add the mushrooms and cook until tender. Reserve the mixture in a bowl.\nIn a blender, whip the eggs and half-and-half until very light, about 90 seconds on high. (A milkshake blender, while not entirely necessary, does offer a little bit more fluff and a bit more fun.)\nGive the skillet a wipe and warm it over medium heat. Swirl the butter in the hot pan to coat it completely. Pour the whipped eggs into the pan and cook until fully set around the outer edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat to low and top the whole surface of the omelet with the spinach and cheddar. Cook until the spinach is slightly wilted and the cheese begins to melt.\nAdd the sausage mixture to one side of the eggs and use 2 spatulas to fold the other half over the side with the sausage mixture. Cook until the eggs are set and the cheese is fully melted, another 2 minutes. The outer surface will be lightly browned in places and likely have some spots where cheese has broken the surface and possibly caramelized on the edges. This is considered a good thing, not unlike “burnt ends” in the BBQ world.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2f5cf9cb0e5f32f6d8c719392dcf6c898027fc1512373406864bca23199c5aa8_v2"}
