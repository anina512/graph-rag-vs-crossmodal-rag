Cook garlic and rosemary (if using), tossing, until garlic is golden brown and rosemary crisps up slightly but isn’t browned, about 30 seconds for rosemary and 2 minutes for garlic. Transfer rosemary to a plate.\nAdd chickpeas, tomato paste, and paprika to skillet and cook, stirring often, until coated, about 1 minute. Mix in cream, season with kosher salt and lots of pepper, and bring to a simmer.\nCrack eggs into chickpea mixture and season them with kosher salt. Cover (a baking sheet works great if you don’t have a matching lid) and cook until white parts of eggs are set but yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drape prosciutto around eggs. Crumble rosemary on top and sprinkle with sea salt, if desired, and more pepper. Serve with flatbread.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<|>EVENT<|>Spicy Creamy Chickpeas is a recipe with ingredients and instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUNNY EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Runny Eggs is a component of the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROSCIUTTO<|>EVENT<|>Prosciutto is a component of the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKPEAS<|>EVENT<|>Chickpeas is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>EVENT<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSEMARY<|>EVENT<|>Rosemary is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy Cream is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive Oil is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLATBREAD<|>EVENT<|>Flatbread is a serving suggestion for the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<|>RUNNY EGGS<|>Runny Eggs is a component of the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<|>PROSCIUTTO<|>Prosciutto is a component of the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<|>CHICKPEAS<|>Chickpeas is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<|>GARLIC<|>Garlic is a key ingredient in the Spicy Creamy Chickpeas recipe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICY CREAMY CHICKPEAS<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
