Soak at least 4 hours, up to 2 days. Overnight is ideal.\nDrain the almonds and place them in a blender with the remaining ingredients. Puree until the almonds are in tiny pieces. Discard the soaking liquid and use new filtered water for pureeing.\nPlace a strainer in a large bowl and cover the top of the strainer with cheesecloth (this step is important because the almonds will be in such small pieces that the cheesecloth and strainer need to stop them from going into the milk).\nPour the almond milk through the cheesecloth. You may need to do this in stages so the milk can slowly strain through the cheesecloth. It may help taking a spoon to scrape the bottom of the cheesecloth so the milk can pass.\nPour the milk and the almond puree into separate containers and refrigerate until ready to drink.\" the pureed almonds can be saved and eaten as a breakfast with typical oatmeal toppings, or as a dessert topped with fresh berries!\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>EVENT<|>Homemade Almond Milk is a recipe for making almond milk at home)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMONDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Almonds are a key ingredient in Homemade Almond Milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AGAVE NECTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agave nectar is a sweetener used in Homemade Almond Milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a flavoring used in Homemade Almond Milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a key ingredient in Homemade Almond Milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEESECLOTH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cheesecloth is used to strain the almond milk)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OATMEAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oatmeal is a topping for the pureed almonds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Berries are a topping for the pureed almonds)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALMONDS<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>Almonds are a key ingredient in Homemade Almond Milk<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AGAVE NECTAR<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>Agave nectar is a sweetener used in Homemade Almond Milk<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>Vanilla extract is a flavoring used in Homemade Almond Milk<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WATER<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>Water is a key ingredient in Homemade Almond Milk<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHEESECLOTH<|>HOMEMADE ALMOND MILK<|>Cheesecloth is used to strain the almond milk<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OATMEAL<|>ALMONDS<|>Oatmeal is a topping for the pureed almonds<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERRIES<|>ALMONDS<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
