Butter a 4-by-8-inch loaf pan. Then, using a sifter or a fine-mesh strainer, dust it with flour, tapping out the excess.\nIn a food process, combine the pistachios and almonds and pulse until finely ground. Set aside.\nCombine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Grate the zest from the lemons directly into the bowl. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until smooth and creamy. Mix in the vanilla just until incorporated. On low speed, gradually add the nuts and mix just until incorporated. Then add the eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition just until incorporated. Stir in the flour and salt and mix just until incorporated.\nSpoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Then, run a paring knife around the inside of the pan to loosen the cake sides, invert the cake onto a plate, and lift off the pan. At this point, the cake can be served warm or allowed to cool completely before being sliced and reheated.\nTo make the orange salad, cut a slice off the top and bottom of 1 orange, stand the orange upright, and cut downward to remove the rind and pith in thick strips. Cut the orange crosswise into 1/4-inch-th\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIO AND ALMOND CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Pistachio and Almond Cake is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE SALAD<|>EVENT<|>Orange Salad is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PISTACHIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pistachio is a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMOND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Almond is a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VALANCIA<|>GEO<|>Valencia is a type of orange used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAVEL<|>GEO<|>Navel is a type of orange used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLOOD ORANGE<|>GEO<|>Blood Orange is a type of orange used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSAULTED SHELLLED PISTACHIO NUTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted shelled pistachio nuts are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOGURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yogurt is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE MARMALADE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange marmalade is an ingredient used in the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
