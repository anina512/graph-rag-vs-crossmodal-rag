Place carrots on a rimmed baking sheet and onions and fennel on another rimmed baking sheet. (Make sure to give them plenty of room, which is key to roasted veggies with nicely browned edges.) Drizzle vegetables with 2 Tbsp. oil, dividing evenly; season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing occasionally, until golden brown and tender, 20–25 minutes for carrots and 35–45 minutes for onions and fennel. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, cook sunflower seeds, coriander seeds, Aleppo pepper, paprika, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring often, until oil is gently bubbling around seeds and spices are fragrant (be careful not to burn), about 2 minutes. Let cool. Stir in vinegar and lemon juice; season vinaigrette with salt and pepper.\nCombine roasted carrots, fennel, and onions onto the same baking sheet, drizzle vinaigrette over, and toss to coat well; transfer to a platter.\nJust before serving, re-toss vegetables to pull up any dressing that may have settled at the bottom of the platter and scatter mint over top.\nDish (without mint) can be made 3 hours ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROASTED CARROTS AND RED ONIONS WITH FENNEL AND MINT<|>EVENT<|>Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint is a recipe that combines roasted carrots, red onions, fennel, and mint with a vinaigrette made from sunflower seeds, coriander seeds, and spices)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROASTED CARROTS<|>EVENT<|>Roasted carrots are a key ingredient in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RED ONIONS<|>EVENT<|>Red onions are a key ingredient in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FENNEL<|>EVENT<|>Fennel is a key ingredient in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MINT<|>EVENT<|>Mint is a key ingredient in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUNFLOWER SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Sunflower seeds are used to make the vinaigrette in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CORIANDER SEEDS<|>EVENT<|>Coriander seeds are used to make the vinaigrette in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALEPPO PEPPER<|>EVENT<|>Aleppo pepper is used to make the vinaigrette in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HUNGARIAN HOT PAPRIKA<|>EVENT<|>Hungarian hot paprika is used to make the vinaigrette in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHERRY VINEGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sherry vinegar is used to make the vinaigrette in the recipe Roasted Carrots and Red Onions with Fennel and Mint)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
