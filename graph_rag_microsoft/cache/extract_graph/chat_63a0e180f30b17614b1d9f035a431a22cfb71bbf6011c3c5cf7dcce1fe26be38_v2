We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom nltk import pos_tag\nfrom nltk import ne_chunk\nfrom nltk import RegexpParser\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the spacy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nFrozen Avocado Cake\n\nIngredients:\n['Softened butter (for the pan)', '8 whole graham crackers (120 g)', '11 digestive biscuits or 4 additional graham crackers (60 g)', '2 (14 oz/397 g) cans sweetened condensed milk', '3 Hass avocados', '1 pound (455 g) cream cheese, at room temperature', 'Pinch fine sea salt', '2 lemons', '2 limes']\n\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).

Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.\nMake the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl.

Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.\nAdd the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about ⅓ cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\nSpread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.\nLet the frozen cake stand at room temperature for 15 to 30\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_63a0e180f30b17614b1d9f035a431a22cfb71bbf6011c3c5cf7dcce1fe26be38_v2"}
