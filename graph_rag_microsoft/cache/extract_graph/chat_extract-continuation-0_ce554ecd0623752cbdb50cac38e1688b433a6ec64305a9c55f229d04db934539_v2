In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the oil and peanut butter and continue to mix until fully incorporated, scraping down the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.\nDecrease the mixer speed to medium-low and add the egg and yolk, one at a time, beating well and scraping the bowl after each addition with a rubber spatula. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. Add the dry ingredients all at once, mixing just to combine.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 350°F [180°C].\nPress the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan, making it as flat and even as possible. Bake for 22 to 27 minutes, until browned and dry to the touch. Let cool.\nFreeze for about 10 minutes (this helps immeasurably with making clean cuts). Alternatively, you can tightly wrap the pan and freeze for up to a week before bringing back to room temperature and cutting and glazing.\nLift the bar cookie from the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PEANUT BUTTER FINGERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peanut Butter Fingers is a type of baked good)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALTY MILK CHOCOLATE GLAZE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salty Milk Chocolate Glaze is a type of topping for baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda is a type of leavening agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a type of leavening agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TABLE SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Table salt is a type of salt used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of butter used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Granulated sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIGHT BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Light brown sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Creamy peanut butter is a type of peanut butter used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Egg yolk is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURE VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pure vanilla extract is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILK"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
