Place panko in large shallow bowl. Place flour in medium bowl. Beat eggs just to blend in another medium bowl. Working in batches, coat veal cutlets in flour, then egg, then panko, pressing gently to adhere. Place on rimmed baking sheet. (Can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)\nPlace wine, broth, lemon juice, thyme, and shallots in heavy large skillet. Cook over medium heat until liquid is reduced almost to glaze, about 10 minutes. Add 10 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, whisking constantly and blending well between additions. Whisk in cream. Remove from heat. Cover to keep sauce warm.\nPreheat oven to 200°F. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches and adding more butter by tablespoonfuls as needed, cook veal until brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to another rimmed baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm.\nGently rewarm sauce over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Divide veal among 4 plates. Drizzle sauce over veal, sprinkle with chives, and serve.\n*Available at many supermarkets and at Asian markets.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
