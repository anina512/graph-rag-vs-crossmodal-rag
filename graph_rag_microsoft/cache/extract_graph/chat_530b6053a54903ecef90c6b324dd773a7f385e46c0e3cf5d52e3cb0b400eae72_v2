Rub steaks with 2 Tbsp. oil; season generously with kosher salt. Cook, turning several times, until lightly charred, 6–8 minutes. Pour off excess oil from skillet. Add butter, thyme, garlic, and cardamom, and cook steaks, tilting skillet and basting with foaming butter, until medium-rare, about 3 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Reserve pan drippings.\nMeanwhile, mix lemon zest and 1 tsp. lemon juice into yogurt in a small bowl; season generously with kosher salt.\nJust before serving, toss radishes, parsley, and remaining 1 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl. Season with kosher salt, drizzle with oil, and toss again to coat.\nSwipe plates with seasoned yogurt and top with steak and radishes.
