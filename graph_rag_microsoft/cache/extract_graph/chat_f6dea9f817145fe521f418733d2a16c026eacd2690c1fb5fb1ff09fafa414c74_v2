Toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, stirring once, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 10–12 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, bring honey, 2 Tbsp. sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally until sugar is dissolved. Add rosemary and lavender and remove from heat. Let sit 5 minutes. Remove rosemary and let syrup cool.\nBring a pinch of salt, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 Tbsp. water to a boil in another small saucepan, stirring to dissolve sugar. Cook (without stirring) until sugar turns a light amber color, about 2 minutes. Add pecans and cook, stirring constantly, until nuts are coated and caramel is a dark amber color, about 2 minutes. Immediately scrape out onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread out into a single layer; let cool. Break into smaller pieces.\nToss nectarines, peaches, lemon zest, and 1/4 cup syrup in a large bowl to coat. Let sit 5 minutes. Gently toss in half of Gorgonzola and half of candied pecans; taste and season with salt if needed. Transfer to a platter. Top with remaining Gorgonzola and candied pecans.\nSyrup can be made 1 month ahead; cover and chill. Pecans can be candied 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f6dea9f817145fe521f418733d2a16c026eacd2690c1fb5fb1ff09fafa414c74_v2"}
