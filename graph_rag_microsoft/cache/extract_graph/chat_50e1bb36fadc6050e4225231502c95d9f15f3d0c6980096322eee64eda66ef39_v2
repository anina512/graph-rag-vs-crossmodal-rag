We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relationships between them.\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform NER and extract the relationships:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Pie Dough\\n\\nIngredients:\\n['1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting', '1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, lard, or vegetable shortening, cut into small pieces (or a combination of butter and shortening equal to 1/2 cup)', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1/4 cup iced water, plus more as needed', '2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting', '1 cup (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, lard, or vegetable shortening, cut into small pieces (or a combination of butter and shortening equal to 1 cup)', '1 teaspoon salt', '1/2 cup iced water, plus more as needed']\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Stir together the flour, butter, and salt to blend. Using a pastry blender or 2 forks, cut the butter into the flour. For pies with liquid fillings (like custard or cooked-fruit fillings that are thickened with cornstarch or tapioca), the bits of fat should be evenly small, and the mixture should resemble a coarse meal. This will result in a mealy piecrust, which is less likely to become soggy as the pie bakes. For pies to be filled with fruit or another non-liquid filling, leave some larger bits of fat, about the size of small walnut pieces, for a crisp and flaky texture in the baked crust.\\n2. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and add the water all at once.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently knead it together, combining parts of the mixture that are wetter with those that are drier. If preparing a double-crust recipe, divide the dough in half. Shape the dough into a 1-inch-thick disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, about 20 minutes. NOTE: At this point, the dough is ready to be used. It can be stored, tightly wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.\n4.
