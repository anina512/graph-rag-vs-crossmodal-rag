Add the onion, zucchini and eggplant and stir-fry for about 4 minutes or until they are just starting to soften and color.\nDrop in the thyme and stir for another minute, then add the tomato paste and mix to coat the vegetables. Keep frying, stirring continuously, for about 45 seconds before pouring in the balsamic vinegar and 1/2 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let the ratatouille bubble away for about 10 minutes, or just until the vegetables are soft. If it seems to be getting too thick, add another 1/4 cup or so of water.\nWhile the veggies are simmering away, slide the salmon fillets into the boiling water. Bring back to a simmer, then cook the fish for 10 minutes, or until just cooked through.\nUsing a slotted spoon, carefully lift the fish out of the water and drain well. Serve up your yummy ratatouille topped with the juicy salmon.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>QUICK POACHED SALMON<|>EVENT<|>Quick Poached Salmon is a recipe for cooking salmon in boiling water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEEDY RAT-ATAT-A-TOUILLE<|>EVENT<|>Speedy Rat-Atat-A-Touille is a recipe for cooking vegetables in a saucepan)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coconut oil is a type of oil used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red onion is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZUCCHINI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Zucchini is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGPLANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggplant is a type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Thyme is a type of herb used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO PASTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato paste is a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Balsamic vinegar is a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALMON FILLETS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmon fillets are a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a type of ingredient used in cooking)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUICK POACHED SALMON<|>SPEEDY RAT-ATAT-A-TOUILLE<|>Quick Poached Salmon and Speedy Rat-Atat-A-Touille are two recipes that can be cooked together<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>RED ONION<|>Coconut oil and red onion are used together in the Speedy Rat-Atat-A-Touille recipe<|>1)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COCONUT OIL<|>ZUCCHINI<|>Coconut oil and zucchini are used together in the Speedy Rat-Atat-A-Touille recipe<|>1)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
