Whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Whisking constantly, gradually add 1 cup warmed coconut milk to egg yolk mixture. Whisking constantly, add egg mixture to milk mixture in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, 7 minutes (mixture should start bubbling halfway through and thicken to a pudding consistency, but be sure to cook the full 7 minutes).\nStrain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Immediately whisk in coconut oil and vanilla. Cover bowl with plastic, pressing on surface of custard. Chill until set, at least 2 hours.\nDo Ahead: Custard can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.\nPreheat oven to 325°. Toast coconut on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden, 7–10 minutes. Let cool.\nLightly coat tart pan with nonstick spray. Mix toasted coconut, egg whites, oil, sugar, and salt with a rubber spatula in a large bowl until combined and the consistency of a stiff paste.\nTransfer coconut mixture to tart pan. Using your hands, press mixture evenly onto bottom and up sides of pan.
