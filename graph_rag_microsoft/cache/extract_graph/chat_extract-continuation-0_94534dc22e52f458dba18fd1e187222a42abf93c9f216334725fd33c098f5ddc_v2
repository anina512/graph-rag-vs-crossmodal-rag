Bring the milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and whisk a little at a time into the egg mixture. Once the bottom of the bowl is warm, slowly whisk in the remaining hot milk. Pour the mixture back into a clean medium saucepan (cleaning the saucepan prevents the pudding from scorching), add the banana liqueur, and whisk over medium-low heat until it thickens, about 2 minutes. Cook while constantly whisking until the pudding is glossy and quite thick, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the pudding to a clean bowl.\nAdd the vanilla and butter and gently whisk until the butter is completely melted and incorporated. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for 4 hours.\nWhile the pudding sets, heat the oven to 325°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Place the wafers in a resealable plastic bag and seal (make sure there is no air in the bag prior to sealing). Using a rolling pin or a flat-bottomed saucepan or pot, crush the vanilla wafers until they're coarsely ground. Transfer them to a small bowl and stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Use a spoon to evenly stir in the melted butter, transfer to the prepared baking sheet, and toast in the oven until brown and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. (The crumbs can be stored in an airtight container for up to 5 days at room temperature or frozen for up to 2 months; re-crisp in a 325°F oven for 6\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BANANA PUDDING<|>EVENT<|>Banana Pudding is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLKS<|>PERSON<|>Egg yolks are a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORNSTARCH<|>PERSON<|>Cornstarch is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>PERSON<|>Whole milk is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANA LIQUEUR<|>PERSON<|>Banana liqueur is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>PERSON<|>Vanilla extract is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsalted BUTTER<|>PERSON<|>Unsalted butter is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIPENED BANANAS<|>PERSON<|>Ripe bananas are a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA WAFERS<|>PERSON<|>Vanilla wafers are a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>PERSON<|>Cinnamon is a key ingredient in Banana Pudding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN<|>GEO<|>Kitchen is where Banana Pudding is prepared)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>Oven is used to toast the vanilla wafers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>GEO<|>Baking sheet is used to toast the vanilla wafers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>GEO<|>Parchment paper is used to line the baking sheet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLLING PIN<|>GEO<|>Rolling pin is used to crush the vanilla w"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
