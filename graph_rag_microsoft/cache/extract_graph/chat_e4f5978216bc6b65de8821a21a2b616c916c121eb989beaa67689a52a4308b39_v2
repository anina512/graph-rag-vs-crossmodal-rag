Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a large bowl, and reserve fat in skillet. (You will need 3 tablespoons fat to cook the potatoes, so add a few more tablespoons of oil if necessary.)\nHeat the skillet over medium. Add potatoes, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Toss potatoes in oil and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, about 18 minutes. Be patient—cooking your potatoes slowly will guarantee a soft, fluffy interior and a perfectly crisp exterior. Add scallions and 1 Tbsp. butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are soft, 2 minutes more. Add potato mixture to chorizo; reserve skillet.\nWhile potatoes cook, combine eggs, milk, 1/4 tsp. salt, and remaining 1/4 tsp. pepper in a medium bowl. Heat tortillas in a dry medium skillet over medium until hot and lightly toasted (or wrap them in damp paper towels and heat in a microwave for about 20 seconds). Wrap in damp paper towels and keep warm between 2 plates.\nHeat reserved skillet over medium and add remaining 1 Tbsp. butter. Add egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until barely set, about 2 minutes. Return sausage and potatoes to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until reheated, about 2 minutes.\nPlace 2 tortillas each on 4 plates and divide egg mixture among tortillas. Top with cheese, hot sauce, avocado, and cilantro.\nChorizo can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e4f5978216bc6b65de8821a21a2b616c916c121eb989beaa67689a52a4308b39_v2"}
