We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nPlum Semifreddo\n\nIngredients:\n['Nonstick vegetable oil spray', '1 1/2 pounds red plums, cut into chunks', '1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1 cup sugar, divided', 'Kosher salt', '3 large egg whites', '1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract', '1 cup chilled heavy cream']\n\nInstructions:\nCoat a 9x5\" loaf pan with nonstick spray and line with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang on all sides.\nCombine plums, cardamom, 1/3 cup sugar, and a pinch of salt in a medium saucepan.

Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.
