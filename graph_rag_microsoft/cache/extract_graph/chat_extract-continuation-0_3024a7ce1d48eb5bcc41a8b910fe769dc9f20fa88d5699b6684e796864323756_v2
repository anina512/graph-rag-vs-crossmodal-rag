Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray cookie sheets with cooking spray or line them with parchment paper. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugar until light in texture and smooth, about 2 minutes. While that mixture is beating, sift the flours, salt, and baking soda into a bowl and set aside.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolk, vanilla, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Add this to the butter-sugar mixture and blend until incorporated. Scrape down the bowl as necessary to blend evenly. With the mixer on low or using a wooden spoon, stir in the sifted dry ingredients.\n3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into two even pieces. Flatten each piece to about 1 inch thick and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, at least 2 hours.\n4. Gently knead the chilled dough to make it more pliable. Lightly flour a work surface and rolling pin and, rotating the dough consistently and working with even pressure, roll out to about an 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into the desired shape and transfer to the prepared baking sheets. Garnish the cookies with sanding sugar.\n5. Bake the cookies in batches until they have a light golden-brown edge with a pale-blond center, about 10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR COOKIES<|>EVENT<|>Sugar Cookies is a recipe for baking cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOURLESS COOKING SPRAY<|>EVENT<|>Flourless cooking spray is used for greasing cookie sheets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsalted BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Unsalted butter is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Cake flour is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>All-purpose flour is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>EVENT<|>Egg is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla extract is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>EVENT<|>Lemon juice is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON ZEST<|>EVENT<|>Lemon zest is used in the recipe for sugar cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDING SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sanding sugar is used for garnishing the cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIE SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Cookie sheets are used for baking the cookies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>EVENT<|>Stand mixer is used for beating the butter and sugar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>EVENT<|>Parchment paper is used for lining the cookie sheets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOODEN SPOON<|>EVENT<|>Wooden spoon is used for stirring the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLLING PIN<|>EVENT<|>Rolling pin is used for rolling out the dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACKS<|>EVENT<|>Wire racks are used for cooling the cookies)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUGAR COOKIES<|>FLOURLESS COOKING SPRAY<|>Sugar Cookies use flourless cooking spray for greasing cookie sheets<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUG"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
