Line a 10-inch springform or Bundt pan with parchment paper. Sift confectioners' sugar, flour, cocoa and ground ginger in a bowl; set aside. Using a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium speed, whip egg whites, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until whites begin to form soft peaks, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase speed to high, add 6 tablespoons granulated sugar and whip until incorporated. Add remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar in 2 increments and whip until whites hold stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently fold dry ingredients into egg mixture with a spatula. Pour batter into pan. Bake until cake springs back when touched, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Loosen edges with a knife; transfer to a serving platter. Chocolate glaze: Bring half-and-half to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a low simmer and add chocolate and confectioners' sugar; whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Pour glaze over top of cake, allowing it to drip down sides. Top with candied ginger. Store at room temperature in a cake saver for up to 3 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE-GINGER ANGEL FOOD CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate-Ginger Angel Food Cake is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>GEO<|>Parchment paper is a type of paper used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS SUGAR<|>GEO<|>Confectioners sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>GEO<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSWEETENED COCOA POWDER<|>GEO<|>Unsweetened cocoa powder is a type of powder used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROUND GINGER<|>GEO<|>Ground ginger is a type of spice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>GEO<|>Egg whites are a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>GEO<|>Vanilla extract is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM OF TARTAR<|>GEO<|>Cream of tartar is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>GEO<|>Salt is a type of ingredient used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANULATED SUGAR<|>GEO<|>Granulated sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALF-AND-HALF<|>GEO<|>Half-and-half is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE<|>GEO<|>Semisweet chocolate is a type of chocolate used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANDIED GINGER<|>GEO<|>Candied ginger is a type of spice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
