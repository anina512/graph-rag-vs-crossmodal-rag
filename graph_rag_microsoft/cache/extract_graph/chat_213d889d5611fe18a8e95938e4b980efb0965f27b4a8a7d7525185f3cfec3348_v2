Toast caraway seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool; finely grind in spice mill or with mortar and pestle.\nRemove ribs and stems from 1 bunch chard; discard. Blanch leaves in a large pot of boiling salted water 10 seconds. Immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water; let cool. Drain and squeeze out excess water. Coarsely chop; transfer to a blender. Add chiles, cilantro, cumin, caraway, 1/4 cup oil, and 1 cup ice. Purée, adding more ice if needed, until smooth; season with salt.\nTrim tough stems from remaining chard; separate leaves from ribs. Tear leaves into large pieces; chop ribs into bite-size pieces. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring often, until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add chard stems, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp-tender and onion is soft, 5–8 minutes. Working in batches, add chard leaves, letting wilt slightly before adding more; cook, tossing often, until all leaves are wilted, about 2 minutes. Pour in purée and use a spoon to create 8 small wells; crack an egg into each well. Sprinkle lightly with salt and harissa powder. Bake until eggs are just set, 20–25 minutes. Top with dill.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_213d889d5611fe18a8e95938e4b980efb0965f27b4a8a7d7525185f3cfec3348_v2"}
