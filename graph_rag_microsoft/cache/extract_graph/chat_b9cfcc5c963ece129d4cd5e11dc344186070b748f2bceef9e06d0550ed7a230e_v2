Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types we're interested in (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    # Define the entity types we're interested in\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n    \n    # Perform entity recognition\n    ents = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            ents.append(ent)\n    \n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce\")\n\n# Perform custom entity recognition\nents = custom_entity_recognition(doc)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor ent in ents:\n    print(f\"('entity'<|>{ent.text.upper()}<|>{ent.label_}<|>{ent.text}')\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll use a combination of NLP techniques and graph algorithms to identify pairs of related entities. We'll define a function that takes two entities as input and returns a score indicating the strength of the relationship between them.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define a function to calculate the relationship strength between two entities\ndef calculate_relationship_strength(ent1, ent2):\n    # Calculate the similarity between the two entities\n    similarity = len(set(ent1.text.split()) & set(ent2.text.split())) / len(set(ent1.text.split()) | set(ent2.text.split()))\n    \n    # Return the similarity as the relationship strength\n    return similarity\n\n# Create a graph to store the relationships between entities\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph representing the relationships between entities\nfor ent1 in ents:\n    for ent2 in ents:\n        if ent1 != ent2:\n            G.add_edge(ent1.text, ent2.text, weight=calculate_relationship_strength(ent1, ent2))\n\n# Print the relationships\nfor edge in G.edges(data=True):\n    print(f\"('relationship'<", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763448266, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2262, "total_tokens": 2774, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.

Place beef on rack set over large rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours.\nMelt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallots; sauté until soft, 3 minutes. Add Cognac, rosemary, and 1 teaspoon cracked pepper and cook until liquid evaporates, 1 minute. Add Port; bring to simmer. Add all of beef stock. Boil until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Strain into medium saucepan, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids in strainer. DO AHEAD: Can be made 24 to 36 hours ahead. Cool slightly, then cover and chill.\nLet beef stand at room temperature 1 hour before roasting. Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425°F. Rub beef all over with oil; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cracked peppercorns, pressing to adhere. Return beef to rack on baking sheet and roast until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of meat registers 125°F for medium-rare (135°F to 140°F in thinnest part), about 30 minutes. Remove roast from oven and let rest 15 minutes.\nBring sauce to boil; whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.\nCut off string from roast. Cut roast crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices; arrange on platter.
