Add butter. Using on/off turns, cut in butter until coarse meal forms. Add yolks and process until moist clumps form. Gather dough into ball. Divide into 6 equal portions. Press 1 dough portion over bottom and up sides of 4 1/4- to 4 1/2-inch-diameter tartlet pan with 3/4-inch-high sides and removable bottom. Repeat with remaining dough, forming 6 tartlets total. Place on rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and chill 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep refrigerated.)\nPreheat oven to 375°F. Bake crusts until golden, pressing with back of fork if crusts bubble, about 20 minutes. Cool.\nWhisk eggs, yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, and lemon peel in medium metal bowl. Place bowl over saucepan of barely simmering water; whisk until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon and lime juices. Whisk until mixture thickens, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; add butter in 3 additions, whisking until smooth. Strain lemon curd through fine sieve into medium bowl. Press plastic directly onto surface of curd. Chill until cold, at least 5 hours.\nPreheat oven to 425°F. Place 1 1/4 cups lemon curd in large bowl; reserve. Divide remaining curd among tartlet crusts, spreading evenly over bottoms.\nUsing electric mixer, beat egg whites in large bowl until frothy. Add salt and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 6 tablespoons sugar, beating\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_52a71f18b052bc3928a5544ae9b9c7f47ba40045218eefbd6ff417da091dc8d8_v2"}
