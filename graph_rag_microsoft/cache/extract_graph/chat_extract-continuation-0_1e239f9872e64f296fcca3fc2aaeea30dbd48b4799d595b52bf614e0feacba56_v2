Simmer, stirring, until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes, then sprinkle cranberries and walnuts evenly over butter mixture and remove from heat.\nPut oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.\nWhisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 6 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture alternately in batches with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing until just combined. (Do not overmix.)\nHeat topping in skillet over moderately high heat until it starts to bubble, then gently spoon batter over topping and spread evenly. Quickly transfer to oven; bake until cake is golden brown and a wooden skewer comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool cake in pan on a rack 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around inside edge of pan, then invert a serving plate over pan and invert cake onto plate. Cool completely on plate on rack, 1 hour.

Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify named entities (organizations, people, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Relationship extraction**: Identify relationships between entities in the text.\n5. **Entity and relationship formatting**: Format the extracted entities and relationships according to the required output format.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform these tasks:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Cranberry Walnut Upside Down Cake\"\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Extract entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent.label_\n    entity_description = ent.text\n    entities.append(f\"({entity_name}<|>{entity_type}<|>{entity_description})\")\n\n# Extract relationships\nrelationships = []\nmatcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\npattern = [{\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"}, {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"}]\nmatcher.add(\"ORGANIZATION_PERSON\", None, pattern)\nmatches = matcher(doc)\nfor match_id, start, end in matches:\n    entity1 = doc[start:end].text\n    entity2 = doc[end:].text\n    relationship_description = f\"{entity1} and {entity2} are related\"\n    relationship_strength = 1\n    relationships.append(f\"({entity1}<|>{entity2}<|>{relationship_description}<|>{relationship_strength})\")\n\n# Format the output\noutput = \"**##\".join(entities + relationships)\nprint(output)\nprint(\"<|COMPLETE|>\")\n```\nThis code uses the spaCy library to perform NER and relationship extraction.
