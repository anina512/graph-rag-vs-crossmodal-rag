Add short ribs and place a small plate on top of short ribs to keep submerged. Cover bowl and chill at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.\nPreheat oven to 325°F. Transfer marinade and ribs to a large Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and braise in oven, turning meat once, until ribs are very tender but not quite falling off the bone, 1 1/2–2 hours.\nTransfer ribs to a medium bowl and cover with foil to keep warm. Strain braising liquid into a medium saucepan; discard solids. Let sit a minute or so to settle, then ladle off fat from surface; discard. Bring braising liquid to a boil and cook, whisking occasionally, until reduced by half, 10–15 minutes.\nWhisk cornstarch and 3 Tbsp. water in a small bowl to make a slurry, then whisk into reduced braising liquid. Cook over medium, whisking constantly, until glaze is thick and bubbling, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice.\nMound rice in center of shallow bowls and place ribs on top. Drizzle about 2 Tbsp. glaze over each (you’ll have plenty left over; save it and serve with grilled steak or chicken). Top with scallion and sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges and Sriracha.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_89ce3ef3110c8bebec2b4cc8a7ca1ee1eff123d4877be7f23c74b5eec78d0ca6_v2"}
