Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces of butter remaining.\nTransfer mixture to a large bowl; drizzle with vinegar and 1/4 cup ice water. Mix with a fork, adding more ice water by the tablespoonful as needed, just until a shaggy dough comes together. Turn out onto a work surface and lightly knead until no dry spots remain (be careful not to overwork). Pat into a disk and wrap in plastic. Chill at least 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 400°F.

Drain tomato mixture and transfer to paper towels.\nUnwrap dough and roll out on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to a 14\" round about 1/8\" thick. Transfer on parchment to a baking sheet. Scatter cheese over dough, leaving a 1 1/2\" border. Arrange tomatoes and garlic over cheese. Bring edges of dough up and over filling, overlapping as needed to create about a 1 1/2\" border; brush dough with egg. Sprinkle tomatoes with sea salt and pepper.
