The cupcakes are done when the centers spring back when you touch them.\nRemove cupcakes from oven. Let cool completely.\nPrepare master recipe for buttercream . Once butter is added, add the peanut butter and salt and mix on high to combine. Taste for seasoning. If desired, add more peanut butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, or a pinch more salt. Continue until, after tasting, your eyes roll into the back of your head.\nPlace the chocolate in a bowl, and shake the bowl back and forth until the chocolate flattens out on top.\nHeat the cream and sea salt in a medium saucepan until it comes to a boil.\nImmediately pour the hot cream mixture over chocolate, and let sit for two minutes to allow chocolate to melt.\nUsing a heatproof spatula, stir the cream and chocolate together until completely smooth.\nAllow to cool slightly before drizzling on the cupcakes. The ganache should not be hot to the touch; it should still be liquid. If it cools completely and becomes solid, microwave it on 50 percent power in 20-second intervals, stirring between each, until desired consistency is reached.\nFill a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip with the peanut buttercream, and pipe onto each chocolate cupcake. Put the cupcakes into the refrigerator so the buttercream hardens, about 20 minutes.\nPulse the pretzels and peanuts in a food processor until they're coarse crumbs. Alternately, place in a strong zip-top bag and repeatedly smack the bag with a rolling pin, a heavy skillet, or anything else you find enjoyable. Place the crumbs in a pie dish or baking pan.\nRemove the cupcakes from the refrigerator and gently roll the sides of the buttercream in the pretzel mixture. Pour a handful of the mixture over the top of each cupcake and lightly pack on with hand. Shake off any excess and set aside.\nDrizzle ganache across each cupcake.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_74f8b5f61cc6120b9ac8720ced9dcc2a713148abbf9a6d392fbda06d6105d186_v2"}
