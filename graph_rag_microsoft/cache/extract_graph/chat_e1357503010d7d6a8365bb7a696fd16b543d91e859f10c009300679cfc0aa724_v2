Identify all entities.

Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-size crumbs form, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add 2 Tbsp. ice water and process until dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers: If it’s very crumbly, pulse in more ice water 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a ball. Knead a few times to combine, then flatten into a disk with smooth edges (no cracks). Cover tightly and chill at least 1 hour.\nRoll out dough to a 13\" round on a lightly floured surface. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9\"-diameter pie dish. Lightly press dough into pan, leaving a 1\" overhang; trim excess. Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Chill until cold, about 30 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be made and shaped into disk 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 3 months. Thaw before rolling.\nPlace racks in bottom third and center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Place a rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack to preheat.\nSpread hazelnuts on another rimmed baking sheet and bake on center rack until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup whole hazelnuts to decorate pie; finely chop remaining hazelnuts.\nMelt chocolate in\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e1357503010d7d6a8365bb7a696fd16b543d91e859f10c009300679cfc0aa724_v2"}
