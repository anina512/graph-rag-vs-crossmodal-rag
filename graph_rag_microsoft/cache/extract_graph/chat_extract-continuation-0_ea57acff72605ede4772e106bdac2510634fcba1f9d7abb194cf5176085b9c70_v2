The stuffed peppers can be made in advance to this point and stored covered in the refrigerator for several days.\nLight the grill. Cook pepper side down over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, until the pepper is charred and soft. Turn the stuffed peppers over and cook on the meat side for 10 minutes. Test for doneness. Serve immediately with your choice of salsas. These are also great cold or cut into slices for sandwiches.\nUse kebab seasoning such as Sadaf, available in Middle Eastern grocery stores.\nUse a Cajun spice blend such as Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's and omit the salt.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
