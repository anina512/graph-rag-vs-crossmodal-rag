Transfer walnuts to a medium bowl. Reserve sieve.\nAdd sliced fennel and lemon zest to syrup; scrape in vanilla seeds and add pod. Bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until fennel is translucent and tender, 20–25 minutes. Discard pod; let fennel cool in syrup.\nFit another medium saucepan with thermometer; pour in oil to come 2\" up sides of pan. Heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F. Add powdered sugar to walnuts and toss to coat. Place in reserved sieve and shake off excess sugar. Carefully add walnuts to oil and cook, turning with a spider or slotted spoon to prevent sticking, until brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet; let cool. Break up any clumps.\nScoop gelato into bowls. Top with ground cherries, blondies broken into large pieces, walnuts, candied fennel, and fennel fronds.\nBlondies can be made 2 days ahead.
