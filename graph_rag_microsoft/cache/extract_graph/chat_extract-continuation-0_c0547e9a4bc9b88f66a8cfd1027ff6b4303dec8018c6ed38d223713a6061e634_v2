Pat dry. Rub skin with sesame oil.\nStir together scallions and soy sauce in a small heatproof bowl.\nHeat wok over high heat until a drop of water vaporizes instantly. Pour oil around side of wok, then tilt wok to swirl oil, coating sides. When oil just begins to smoke, carefully add ginger (oil will spatter) and stir-fry 30 seconds. Immediately remove from heat and pour over scallion mixture, stirring to combine (scallions will wilt).\nTo cut and serve chicken on a platter (Chinese restaurant–style), cut off the head and neck (if attached) with a cleaver and put at one end of a large platter. (These parts, along with the back and feet, aren't always eaten.) Cut off the feet. Cut off the drumsticks and thighs, then cut crosswise through the boneinto 1-inch pieces. Place the feet and leg meat at the other end of the platter. Cut off the wings, separating them at the joints, and put on the sides of the platter. Cut through the ribs, separating breast from back, then cut the backbone crosswise into 3 pieces and put them in the center of the platter. (Striking the cleaver with a rubber mallet makes the cuts clean.) Cut the breast crosswise through the bone into 1-inch pieces and arrange on the back. Alternatively, cut chicken according to procedure and mound pieces in a bowl.\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons dipping sauce over chicken and sprinkle with cilantro leaves. Serve warm or at room temperature, with remaining dipping sauce on the side.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken is a type of food that can be cooked in various ways)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken is a popular dish in many Chinese restaurants)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken can be cut into various parts such as legs, wings, and breasts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken can be served with dipping sauce and garnished with cilantro)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN<|>PERSON<|>Chicken can be cooked in a wok with oil and ginger)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is a common ingredient used in cooking chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>PERSON<|>Ginger is used to add flavor to the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME OIL<|>PERSON<|>Sesame oil is used to rub the skin of the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME OIL<|>PERSON<|>Sesame oil is used to add flavor to the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>PERSON<|>Scallions are used to add flavor to the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCALLIONS<|>PERSON<|>Scallions are used to make a dipping sauce for the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>PERSON<|>A wok is a cooking vessel used to cook the chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOK<|>PERSON<|>A wok is used to stir-fry the chicken with ginger and oil)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE RESTAURANT<|>PERSON<|>A Chinese restaurant is a place where people can eat chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE RESTAURANT<|>PERSON<|>A Chinese restaurant is a place where people can eat chicken in a platter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE RESTAURANT<|>PERSON<|>A Chinese restaurant is a place where people can eat chicken with dipping sauce)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHICKEN<|>GINGER<|>Chicken is often cooked with ginger to add flavor<|>8)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
