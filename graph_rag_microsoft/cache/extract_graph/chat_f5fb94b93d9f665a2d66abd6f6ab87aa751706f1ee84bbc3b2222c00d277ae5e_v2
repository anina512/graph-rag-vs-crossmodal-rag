We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nCandied Sweet Potato\n\nIngredients:\n['1/4 cup granulated or packed light brown sugar', '1/4 cup vegetable oil', '2 tablespoons water', '1 teaspoon soy sauce', '1 teaspoon rice vinegar', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '2 large Japanese-style sweet potatoes, about 1 pound total weight, unpeeled, cut ran-giri style into chunks', '1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons black sesame seeds, freshly dry-roasted']\n\nInstructions:\nCombine the sugar, vegetable oil, water, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt in a skillet just large enough to hold the sweet potato chunks in a single layer. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Arrange the sweet potatoes in the pan in a single layer and cover with a circle of parchment paper to keep the surface moist. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Cover the skillet with a lid (keep the parchment in place) and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender. A toothpick inserted into the thickest part of a piece should meet no resistance. If the chunks are not yet tender, add a bit more water and simmer for another minute or two. Check to make sure the sugar doesn't burn.\nOnce the potatoes are tender, remove the lid and parchment and jiggle the skillet to allow the potato chunks to roll around in the rapidly reducing glaze (the vinegar, by the way, will keep the sugar from seizing after the glaze has cooled).

Identify all entities.
