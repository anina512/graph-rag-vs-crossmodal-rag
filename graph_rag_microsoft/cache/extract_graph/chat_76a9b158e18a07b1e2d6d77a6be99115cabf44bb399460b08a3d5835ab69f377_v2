Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Let cool; set aside.\nMeanwhile, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Boil scallions, peppers, and carrot tops until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl of ice water and let cool. Drain and squeeze out as much excess water with your hands as possible. Transfer to a plate and chill in freezer 5 minutes (this will keep the dip bright green).\nFinely grind nori in a blender; transfer to a small bowl. Wipe out blender, then blend vinegar, soy sauce, and reserved nuts in blender until nuts are coarsely chopped. Add chilled vegetable mixture and blend, streaming in oil, until very smooth (this may take up to 4 minutes, depending on your blender). If mixture seems thick, add 1 Tbsp. water to loosen.\nTransfer dip to a bowl and sprinkle with nori powder. Serve with vegetables alongside for dipping.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_76a9b158e18a07b1e2d6d77a6be99115cabf44bb399460b08a3d5835ab69f377_v2"}
