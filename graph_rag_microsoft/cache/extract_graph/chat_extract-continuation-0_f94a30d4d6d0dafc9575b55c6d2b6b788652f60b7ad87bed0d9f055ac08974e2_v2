Add enough water to cover the ingredients by 1 inch and bring to a boil, skimming off any foam that rises to the top. Lower the heat to moderately low and let the stock simmer, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a very gentle simmer, until richly aromatic, about 4 hours. Let the stock cool slightly then pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, discarding solids. Measure 8 cups of stock for the ramen bowls and reserve the rest for later use. DO AHEAD: The turkey stock can be prepared ahead and kept, covered in the refrigerator, up to 4 days, or frozen, in an airtight\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TURKEY RAMEN<|>EVENT<|>Turkey Ramen is a recipe for a dish that combines turkey and ramen noodles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Turkey is a type of poultry used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAMEN NOODLES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ramen noodles are a type of noodle used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COUNTRY HAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Country ham is a type of cured meat used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAIKON RADISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Daikon radish is a type of root vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of bulb used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GINGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ginger is a type of root used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of food used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED MISO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Red miso is a type of fermented soybean paste used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FISH SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fish sauce is a type of condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Soy sauce is a type of condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>White distilled vinegar is a type of vinegar used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot sauce is a type of condiment used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Shiitake mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVOCADO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Avocado is a type of"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
