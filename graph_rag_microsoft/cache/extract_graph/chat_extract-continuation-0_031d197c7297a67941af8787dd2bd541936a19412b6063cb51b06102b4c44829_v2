Whisk yolks in a bowl until blended, then add hot cream mixture in a slow stream, whisking. Transfer custard back to saucepan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thick enough to coat back of spoon and registers 175 to 180°F on thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes (do not let boil).\nImmediately pour through a fine-mesh sieve into cleaned bowl, then stir in lemon juice. Cool custard to room temperature, stirring occasionally, then chill, its surface covered with a round of wax paper, until cold, about 3 hours.

We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem statement (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    # Define entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n    # Define entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\"},\n    ]\n\n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n\n    # Add patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n\n    # Perform entity recognition\n    ents = []\n    for ent in matcher(doc):\n        ents.append(doc[ent[1] : ent[2]])\n\n    return ents\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Frozen Lemon Gingersnap Pie\")\n\n# Perform custom entity recognition\nents = custom_entity_recognition(doc)\n\n# Print entities\nfor ent in ents:\n    print(f\"({ent.text}<|>{ent.text}<|>{ent.ent_type_}<|>{ent.text})\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Relationship Identification\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform relationship identification on the entities identified in the previous step.
