Using a sturdy chefs knife, roughly chop the almonds.\nPlace in a hot oven until toasted, 5 to 7 minutes.\nRemove the sheet from the oven, and immediately add the butter and salt. Gather up the corners of the aluminum foil, pinch to seal, then vigorously shake to coat the almonds. Set aside to cool.\nPrepare the recipe for French Buttercream .

Identify all entities.
