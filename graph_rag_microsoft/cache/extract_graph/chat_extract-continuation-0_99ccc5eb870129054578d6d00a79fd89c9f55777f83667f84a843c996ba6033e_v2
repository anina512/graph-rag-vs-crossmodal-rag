Pull out remaining pin feathers with pliers. Place geese, side by side, on large rack set in large roasting pan. Place wing tips and necks in pan. Refrigerate uncovered at least 1 day and up to 2 days for skin to dry.\nPreheat oven to 325°F. Sprinkle main cavity of each goose with salt and pepper. Place half of herb sprigs, lemons, garlic, and onions into each. Using small metal pins, skewer cavities closed. Place each goose, breast side down, on rack. Pierce skin on back all over with small sharp knife (do not pierce flesh).\nRoast geese 1 1/2 hours. Using large spoon or bulb baster, transfer fat collected in bottom of roasting pan to bowl; leave juices in pan. Turn geese breast side up. Continue to roast geese until legs move easily, skin around thighs and breasts is puffed, and thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 175°F to 180°F, about 2 hours longer. Transfer to platter; tent loosely with foil. Let rest 30 to 45 minutes. If desired, reserve roasting pan with juices to make pan sauce.\nCarve geese and serve with aged balsamic vinegar or Balsamic Pan Sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heirloom goose is a type of goose used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Balsamic vinegar is a type of vinegar used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>EVENT<|>Roast Heirloom Goose is a recipe for roasting geese)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BALSAMIC PAN SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Balsamic Pan Sauce is a type of sauce used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAGE<|>PERSON<|>Sage is a type of herb used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>PERSON<|>Thyme is a type of herb used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>PERSON<|>Lemon is a type of fruit used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a type of vegetable used in roasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>PERSON<|>Onion is a type of vegetable used in roasting)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>BALSAMIC VINEGAR<|>Heirloom goose is often served with balsamic vinegar<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>BALSAMIC PAN SAUCE<|>Roast Heirloom Goose is often served with Balsamic Pan Sauce<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>SAGE<|>Sage is often used in roasting geese<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>THYME<|>Thyme is often used in roasting geese<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>LEMON<|>Lemon is often used in roasting geese<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROAST HEIRLOOM GOOSE<|>GARLIC<|>Garlic is often used"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
