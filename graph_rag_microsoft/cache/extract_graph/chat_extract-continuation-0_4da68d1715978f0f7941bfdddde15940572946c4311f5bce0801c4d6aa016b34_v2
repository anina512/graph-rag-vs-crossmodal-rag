In a small saucepan, melt the butter and blend in the lime juice, chili powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.\nSplit the lobsters completely in half down the back with a chef's knife. Remove the tails and claws. Discard the rest. Crack the shells on the claws and inject or drizzle them each with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Season the tails lightly with the rub. Grill the tails and claws for about 5 minutes on each side. Spoon some of the Chili-Lime Butter into the tail shells. Cook until the lobster is just barely done, another 4 to 5 minutes. This will vary depending on your grill. Serve the remaining Chili-Lime Butter for dipping.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DR.
