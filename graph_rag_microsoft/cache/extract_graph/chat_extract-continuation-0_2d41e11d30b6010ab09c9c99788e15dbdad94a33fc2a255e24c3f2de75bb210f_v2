Place 15x10x2-inch glass baking dish on rimmed baking sheet. Combine 8 cups water, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and 2 teaspoons salt in dish. Gradually mix in polenta.\nPlace baking sheet with polenta in oven. Bake polenta 1 hour. Add pepper and stir to blend. Bake 20 minutes. Stir again and spread evenly. Bake until polenta is very thick, about 20 minutes longer. Cool polenta to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours (polenta will become firm). Using metal spatula, press polenta all over to even thickness. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover with plastic wrap; chill.\nPreheat oven to 325°F. Cut polenta lengthwise into 4 strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 6 squares. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add polenta squares. Sauté until crisp and beginning to color, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer polenta to small baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining polenta, adding oil to skillet as needed.\nDivide polenta among plates. Top with warm Spicy Tomato-Basil Sauce. Garnish with fresh basil sprigs, if desired.\nSold at some supermarkets and at natural foods stores and Italian markets. If unavailable, substitute an equal amount of regular yellow cornmeal.\nA medium-bodied red Italian wine is great with the spicy sauce. One to try: Montresor NV \"Il Veronese\" Valpolicella ($14), a lovely red blend with dried fruit flavors and vanilla notes.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PAN-SEARED POLENTA<|>EVENT<|>Pan-Seared Polenta is a dish made with polenta and Spicy Tomato-Basil Sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPICY TOMATO-BASIL SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Spicy Tomato-Basil Sauce is a sauce used in Pan-Seared Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLENTA<|>EVENT<|>Polenta is a dish made from cornmeal)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>EVENT<|>Water is used in the preparation of Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is used in the preparation of Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is used in the preparation of Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESH BASIL<|>EVENT<|>Fresh basil is used as a garnish for Pan-Seared Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONTRESOR NV \"IL VERONESE\" VALPOLELLA<|>EVENT<|>Montresor NV \"Il Veronese\" Valpolicella is a red Italian wine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERMARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some supermarkets sell Pan-Seared Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURAL FOODS STORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some natural foods stores sell Pan-Seared Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALIAN MARKET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Some Italian markets sell Pan-Seared Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REGULAR YELLOW CORNMEAL<|>EVENT<|>Regular yellow cornmeal is a substitute for polenta)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN-SEARED POLENTA<|>SPICY TOMATO-BASIL SAUCE<|>Pan-Seared Polenta is served with Spicy Tomato-Basil Sauce<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN-SEARED POLENTA<|>POLENTA<|>Pan-Seared Polenta is a dish made with polenta<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>WATER<|>Polenta is made with water<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POLENTA<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
