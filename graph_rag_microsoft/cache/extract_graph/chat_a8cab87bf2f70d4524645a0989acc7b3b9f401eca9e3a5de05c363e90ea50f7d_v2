Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n2. **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: Identify the part of speech (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.\n3. **Named entity recognition (NER)**: Identify the entities (such as organizations, people, locations, etc.) in the text.\n4. **Dependency parsing**: Analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence to identify relationships between entities.\n5. **Relationship extraction**: Identify relationships between entities based on the dependency parsing results.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that uses the spaCy library to perform these tasks:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.util import filter_spans\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"Tomato Fried Rice\"\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n        entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n\n# Identify relationships\nrelationships = []\nmatcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\npattern = [{\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\"}, {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\"}]\nmatcher.add(\"ORGANIZATION_PERSON\", [pattern])\nmatches = matcher(doc)\nfor match_id, start, end in matches:\n    span = doc[start:end]\n    source_entity = span[0].text\n    target_entity = span[1].text\n    relationship_description = f\"{source_entity} is related to {target_entity}\"\n    relationship_strength = 1\n    relationships.append((source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n\n# Format the output\noutput = []\nfor entity in entities:\n    output.append(f\"('entity'<|>{entity[0].upper()}<|>{entity[1]}<|>{entity[0]}')\")\nfor relationship in relationships:\n    output.append(f\"('relationship'<|>{relationship[0].upper()}<|>{relationship[1].upper()}<|>{relationship[2]}<|>{relationship[3]}", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763450898, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2172, "total_tokens": 2684, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n \n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Thinly slice white and pale green parts; set aside separately. Quarter any larger tomatoes and halve any small ones. Place about one-quarter of tomatoes in a small bowl; season generously with salt and toss to combine. Set aside.\nHeat 1 Tbsp. sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add reserved white and pale green parts of scallions and remaining 3/4 of tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and any liquid from tomatoes has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Mix in garlic and ginger; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add rice and stir to separate grains. Cook just to heat rice through, about 3 minutes.\nScoot vegetables and rice to 1 side of skillet, then pour half of remaining sesame oil into pan. Add eggs and cook, stirring often, until just set, about 1 minute. Mix into vegetables and rice, then drizzle in soy sauce and cook, stirring, just until well combined.\nTransfer fried rice to a large bowl or platter. Drain salted tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, and spoon over rice. Sprinkle with reserved scallion tops and red pepper flakes (if using) and drizzle with remaining sesame oil.
