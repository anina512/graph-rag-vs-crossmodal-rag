Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n\n2. **Entity Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities.
