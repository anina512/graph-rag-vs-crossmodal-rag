Toast them in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside.\nPlace the crisp toasted chiles in a food processor and process until finely ground. Set aside.\nOn a griddle or in a small cast-iron skillet, heat the reserved chile seeds over high heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until thoroughly charred and black on all sides, about 5 minutes. (Because of the fumes, this is best done outdoors if you have the means.) You can speed the process by sprinkling a few drops of vegetable oil over the seeds and igniting with a match, standing well back from the flame and taking care to shield your face, clothing, and hair. Place the charred seeds in a bowl, cover with at least 2 cups cold water, and soak for 1 1/2 hours, changing the water twice. Drain and set aside.\nHeat a griddle or medium-size cast-iron skillet over low heat. If using 1 large onion, cut it in half crosswise (leaving the skin on). Place the onion, individual unpeeled garlic cloves, tomato (stem side down), and tomatillos (in the husks) on the griddle. Cook, turning frequently. The onion and garlic are done when they are somewhat softened, about 8 minutes for the garlic and 20 to 25 minutes for the onion. The tomato is done when the skin is blackened and blistered all over, about 15 to 20 minutes. The tomatillos are done when they are lightly softened all over, about 10 to 15 minutes. (Handle them delicately so as not to squeeze them and pierce the skin, and turn frequently to avoid scorching.) Remove each kind of vegetable as it is done and set it aside in a separate small bowl.\nWhen the vegetables are cool enough to handle, remove the husks from the tomatillos and peel the rest, making sure to save the juices. If using a large onion cut in half, scrape the black bits off the cut side.\nPlace the sesame seeds in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium heat and toast just until golden (about 3 minutes), stirring constantly and shaking the pan. Immediately scrape out the seeds into a small bowl to stop the cooking. Set aside.\nIn a small, heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon l\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pecans are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALMONDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Almonds are a type of nut used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chiles are a type of pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron skillet is a type of cooking vessel used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRIDDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Griddle is a type of cooking surface used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOASTED CHILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toasted chiles are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRISP TOASTED CHILES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crisp toasted chiles are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARRED SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Charred seeds are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cold water is used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Onion is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato is a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATILLOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomatillos are a type of vegetable used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SESAME SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sesame seeds are a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUICES"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
