Invert jars and immediately ladle hot jelly into jars, leaving 1/4 inch of space at top. (Last jar may not be full.) Run a clean plastic spatula between jelly and sides of jars to eliminate air bubbles. Wipe off rims of filled jars with a damp clean kitchen towel, then firmly screw on lids with screw bands.\nPut sealed jars on rack in canner or pot and add enough hot water to cover by 2 inches. (If you have a jar that is partially full, do not process it. Cover it with a lid and screw band, then keep in refrigerator.) Bring to a full boil, covered, then boil jelly, covered, 15 minutes. Transfer jars with canning tongs to a towel-lined surface to cool. Jars will seal; if you hear a ping, that means that the vacuum formed above the cooling jelly has made the lid concave. Remember that you may or may not be around to hear the ping. The important thing is for the jars to eventually have concave lids. Jelly will thicken as it cools.\nAfter jars have cooled, 12 to 24 hours, press center of each lid to check that it's concave, then remove screw band and try to lift lid with your fingertips. If you can't, the lid has a good seal. Replace screw band. Put any jars that haven't sealed properly in the refrigerator and use them first (along with jar that was only partially full).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CANNING TONGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Canning tongs are used to handle jars during the canning process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jars are used to store the canned jelly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kitchen towels are used to dry the jars and lids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A plastic spatula is used to eliminate air bubbles in the jelly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pot is used as a canner to process the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CANNER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A canner is a specialized pot used for canning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREW BAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Screw bands are used to secure the lids on the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lids are used to seal the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JELLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jelly is the food being canned)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rack is used to hold the jars during processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is used to cover the jars during processing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The kitchen is the location where the canning process takes place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFRIGERATOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The refrigerator is used to store jars that haven't sealed properly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A jar is a container used to store the canned jelly)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A towel is used to dry the jars and lids)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAMP KITCHEN TOWEL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A damp kitchen towel is used to wipe off the rims of the jars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Hot water is used to cover"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
