Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Roughly tear the basil leaves and put them in a small bowl. Pour the lemon juice mixture over the basil leaves and let steep for at least 15 minutes.\nPour the orange juice into a small saucepan and sprinkle the gelatin over its surface. Let the gelatin soften for 5 minutes, then warm the pan over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the gelatin is fully dissolved. Turn off the heat.\nStrain the basil out of the lemon juice and whisk the juice into the gelatin mixture. Pour the liquid into six small cups or a 1-quart (1-L) dish. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or until softly set. Garnish with whipped cream and basil leaves to serve.\nTo make little bites for a party, double the amount of gelatin in this recipe to 6 full teaspoons. Pour the mixture into an 8- or 9-inch (20- or 23-cm) square baking dish and let it set overnight in the refrigerator. Cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) squares, or use a small cookie cutter to cut out 1-inch (2.5-cm) circles. Skewer one or two pieces on a toothpick or party pick with a leaf of fresh basil folded and skewered at one end. Chill until ready to serve, and pass a bowl of whipped cream for dipping.\nReal Lime Jelly For real lime jelly (with the taste of fresh limes and no nasty green food coloring), substitute juice from 7 to 8 limes for the lemon juice. Substitute water for the orange juice. Meyer Lemon Jelly with Lavender Extra-sweet, less acidic Meyer lemons are also wonderful in this jelly, especially with the herbal-floral taste of lavender. Simply substitute Meyers for the regular lemons. You may need one or two extra\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY WITH BASIL<|>EVENT<|>Lemonade Jelly with Basil is a recipe for a sweet and tangy dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY<|>EVENT<|>Lemonade Jelly is a type of dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASIL<|>EVENT<|>Basil is a type of herb used in the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>EVENT<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit used in the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE<|>EVENT<|>Orange is a type of citrus fruit used in the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GELATIN<|>EVENT<|>Gelatin is an ingredient used in the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHIPPED CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Whipped cream is a topping used in the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY WITH LAVENDER<|>EVENT<|>Lemonade Jelly with Lavender is a variation of the Lemonade Jelly with Basil recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEYER LEMON JELLY<|>EVENT<|>Meyer Lemon Jelly is a type of dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAVENDER<|>EVENT<|>Lavender is a type of herb used in the Meyer Lemon Jelly with Lavender recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REAL LIME JELLY<|>EVENT<|>Real Lime Jelly is a type of dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIME<|>EVENT<|>Lime is a type of citrus fruit used in the Real Lime Jelly recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY WITH BASIL<|>LEMON<|>Lemonade Jelly with Basil uses lemons as an ingredient<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY WITH BASIL<|>ORANGE<|>Lemonade Jelly with Basil uses oranges as an ingredient<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONADE JELLY WITH BASIL<|>GELATIN<|>Lemonade Jelly with Basil uses gel"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
