Put the topping in the refrigerator while you make the fruit filling. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F. To make the fruit filling, remove the stem from each fig, then boil the figs in 1 cup of water for 5 minutes. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle. Slice each fig into 4 to 5 pieces, put them in a large bowl, and add the apples, pears, and cranberries. Separately, rub the sugar and cornstarch together, then add to the fruit and gently toss until evenly coated. Transfer the filling to the pie shell and top with the walnut crumb.
