Identify all entities.

Line with parchment with a 2-inch overhang on 2 sides, and oil the parchment. Place a small bowl of warm water and a pastry brush near the cooktop.\nIn a small saucepan, combine the cream, apple butter, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Heat over low heat until warm, stirring to combine. Keep warm over low heat.\nMeanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the corn syrup to a boil, swirling the pan to evenly heat, about 45 seconds. Add one third of the sugar and poke it into the bubbling syrup with a heatproof spatula to remove all the lumps and evenly moisten. There should be no visible clumps of sugar visible. Repeat with two more additions, then stop poking. Cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the mixture is very dark amber and registers 320° F on a candy thermometer, about 8 minutes total. If the sugar crystallizes on the sides of the pan, dip the pastry brush in cold water and brush away the crystals.\nWhen the sugar mixture is ready, remove from the heat and carefully add the warm cream mixture, then the butter. The mixture will bubble up and steam. Immediately whisk until very smooth and emulsified. At this point, the caramel should register 245° F on a candy thermometer.\nCarefully pour the caramel into the prepared pan. If necessary, tilt the pan to form an even layer. Let stand at room temperature until cool and firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\nLift the caramel out of the pan with the parchment paper and place on a cutting board. Work quickly to cut the caramel\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_90dad4dd1381b9e4f9522e0f376048279f6f3c55a33c5d0bdfb3caddaccd63ba_v2"}
