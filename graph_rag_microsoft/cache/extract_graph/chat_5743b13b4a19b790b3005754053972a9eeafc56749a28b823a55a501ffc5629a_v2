We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nChocolate-Raspberry Soufflé\n\nIngredients:\n['1/4 cup unsalted, shelled raw pistachios', 'Unsalted butter (for ramekins)', '1/2 cup sugar, plus more for ramekins', '6 ounces high-quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped', '1/4 cup high-quality raspberry jam or jelly', '1 large egg yolk', '1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more', '6 large egg whites, room temperature', '1/2 cup heavy cream', '4 (6-ounce) ramekins']\n\nInstructions:\nPosition rack in center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until fragrant and slightly darkened, 5–6 minutes.
