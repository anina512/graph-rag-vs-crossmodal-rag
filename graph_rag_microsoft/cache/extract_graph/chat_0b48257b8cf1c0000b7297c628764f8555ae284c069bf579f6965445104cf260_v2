We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information for each entity.

Alternately, formed crusts can be frozen up to 3 months and thawed in a refrigerator before use.\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line the chilled crust with a large strip of foil (not parchment or wax paper), letting the excess loosely cover the rim.
