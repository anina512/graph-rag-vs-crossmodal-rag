Line cupcake tins with paper liners. Fill the liners two-thirds full with the batter. Place 1 marble or tinfoil ball between each liner and the tin. This will make a dent in your cupcake when it bakes to make it heart-shaped. Bake the cupcakes as directed in the recipe . If you are using marbles, be careful when removing the cupcakes from the tins because the marbles will be very hot.\n2. With a small paring knife, cut out a circle about the size of a dime in the center of each cupcake, going about two thirds of the way in. Pull the little plug of cake out. Cut off the top of this piece (about 1/2 inch thick) and eat or discard the bottom. Use a teaspoon or a squeeze bottle to fill the hole partway with the strawberry jelly \"blood.\" Put the little cake plug back in. Continue with the rest of the hearts.\n3. Put one third of the frosting into two separate bowls. Color one bowl of frosting with the red food coloring. Tint the other bowl of the frosting blue. Tint the remaining two thirds pink.\n4. Frost the cupcakes with the pink frosting. Make it super smooth by dipping a butter or frosting/palette knife in a bowl of hot water and smoothing it over the top. With the pastry bag or a knife, use the red and blue frosting to make veins on the hearts.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>White Cupcakes is a recipe for cupcakes used in the Bleeding Heart Cupcakes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BUTTER CREAM FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla Butter Cream Frosting is a recipe for frosting used in the Bleeding Heart Cupcakes recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Bleeding Heart Cupcakes is a recipe for heart-shaped cupcakes with strawberry jelly \"blood\" and colored frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLEEDING HEART CUPCAKES"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
