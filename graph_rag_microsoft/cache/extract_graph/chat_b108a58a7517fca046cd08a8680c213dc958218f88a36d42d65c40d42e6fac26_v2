We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER), and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that implements the above steps:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nLemon Pudding\n\nIngredients:\n['8 jumbo eggs', '2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar', '1 tablespoon cornstarch', '1/4 cup sugar', '1 cup half-and-half', '2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice', '1 tablespoon unsalted butter', '1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest', '1/4 cup fresh lemon juice', '1/4 cup sugar', '3 reserved jumbo egg yolks (from emptied shells)', '2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces', 'Accompaniment: trompe l\\'oeil \"toasts\"]\n\n\nInstructions:\nCarefully remove and discard top third of each eggshell by tapping around egg with a knife, then gently prying off top.
