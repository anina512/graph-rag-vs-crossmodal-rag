Drain and run under cold water. Use a paper towel to peel the beets, then cut into 1/2-inch dice.\nPut the beets in a medium heatproof bowl. Combine the water, vinegar, and sugar in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring, to dissolve the sugar. Add the salt and peppercorns and bring to a boil. Strain the hot marinade over the beets and stir in the ginger. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate overnight.\nThe next day, drain the beets and transfer to a bowl. (You can reserve the marinade to use again; store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.) Add the soy sauce and sesame oil to the beets and toss well.\nToss the diced carrots and sweet onion together in another bowl.\nDivide the beets, rice, seaweed salad, and carrot-onion mix among four shallow bowls, arranging them in separate piles so that the colors and textures really stand out.
