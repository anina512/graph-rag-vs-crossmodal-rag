Pulse together the flour, vegan butter, and vegan shortening until it looks chunky and sandy. Add the sugar, olive oil, cinnamon, salt, and allspice and pulse again. While pulsing, slowly drizzle in 2 to 3 tablespoons cold water, little by little-just until a loose dough ball is formed and spins around the bowl of the food processor. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes or up to 2 days.\n6. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.\n7. On a work surface dusted with flour, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thick. Use a 4-inch-wide circle cutter to stamp out the turnover shells. Place 1 heaping tablespoon of the sweet potato filling in the center of each dough circle. Bring the edges of the circle together, forming a half circle, and pinch them together tightly. Use a fork to crimp the edges of the seal. Arrange the turnovers on the prepared sheet pan.\n8. Bake the turnovers until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Arrange on serving dishes with the sweet kraut and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TURNOVER<|>EVENT<|>Turnover is a type of pastry that is made by rolling out dough and filling it with sweet potato and then baking it in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEET POTATO<|>EVENT<|>Sweet potato is a filling used in the turnover pastry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Olive oil is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON<|>EVENT<|>Cinnamon is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>EVENT<|>Salt is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALLSPICE<|>EVENT<|>Allspice is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGAN BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Vegan butter is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGAN SHORTENING<|>EVENT<|>Vegan shortening is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD WATER<|>EVENT<|>Cold water is an ingredient used in the turnover pastry dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEET KRAUT<|>EVENT<|>Sweet kraut is a side dish served with the turnover pastry)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNOVER<|>SWEET POTATO<|>Turnover is filled with sweet potato<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNOVER<|>OLIVE OIL<|>Turnover pastry dough contains olive oil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNOVER<|>CINNAMON<|>Turnover pastry dough contains cinnamon<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNOVER<|>SALT<|>Turnover pastry dough contains salt<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNOVER<|>ALLSPICE<|>Turnover pastry dough contains allspice<|>8)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
