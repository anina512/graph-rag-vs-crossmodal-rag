We will first identify the entities in the text using named entity recognition (NER) and then extract the relevant information about each entity. We will also identify the relationships between the entities using dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL).\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the spaCy library to perform the entity recognition and relationship extraction:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nMole Coloradito\n\nIngredients:\n['4 plum tomatoes, hulled', '3 tomatillos, husks removed, rinsed', '1/2 large white onion, halved', '1 head of garlic', '8 ancho chiles, ribs and seeds removed', '6 guajillo chiles, ribs and seeds removed', '1/4 cup raisins', '1/2 cup sesame seeds', '1/2 Ceylon cinnamon stick or 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '2 allspice berries', '2 whole cloves', '1 teaspoon cumin seeds', '2 tablespoons vegetable oil', '4 cups low-sodium chicken broth', 'Kosher salt', '2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped', '2 tablespoons breadcrumbs', '1 tablespoon grated piloncillo (unrefined whole cane sugar) or dark brown sugar', 'A spice mill']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 450°F. Roast tomatoes, tomatillos, onion, and garlic on a rimmed baking sheet on upper rack until softened and browned in spots (vegetables should still hold their shape), 25–35 minutes. Let cool slightly. Cut the top off the garlic, exposing the cloves inside. Squeeze out roasted garlic cloves into a blender. Transfer remaining vegetables to blender and purée until smooth. Scrape into a medium bowl.\nWhile the vegetables are roasting, toast ancho and guajillo chiles on a clean rimmed baking sheet on lower rack until guajillo chiles are slightly darker in spots, about 4 minutes.

Identify all entities.
