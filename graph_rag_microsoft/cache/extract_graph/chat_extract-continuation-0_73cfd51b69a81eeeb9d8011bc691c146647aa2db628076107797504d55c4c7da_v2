Add the vanilla and stir to blend well.\nAdd the chocolate mixture to the egg mixture and blend completely on low speed. Stop and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with the rubber spatula. The mixture will be smooth and dark chocolate colored.\nIn a medium bowl, sift the flour and cocoa powder together. Add the salt and stir to combine.\nIn 3 stages, add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, blending well after each addition. Stop and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to help mix evenly.\nPour the batter into the prepared pan and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly. Bake for 35 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out with slightly moist crumbs clinging to it. Remove the pan from the oven and cool completely on a rack.\nStir the caramel sauce until it is smooth. Pour it onto the top of the cooled brownies and spread evenly into the corners using a small offset spatula. Chill in the freezer for 30 minutes to set the caramel.\nPlace the chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until bubbles for around the edges. Pour the cream over the chocolate and let stand for 30 seconds. Stir the cream and chocolate together with a heat-resistant spatula until completely melted and smooth.\nRemove the pan of brownies from the freezer. Pour the ganache over the caramel layer and spread it out evenly into the corners using a small offset spatula. Chill the brownies in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to set the ganache.\nLift the brownies from the pan using the edges of the aluminum foil then peel away from the brownies. Use a large knife to cut the brownies into 5 rows in each direction. Dip the knife in hot water and dry between cuts. Gently separate the brownies and serve at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The chocolate mixture is a blend of chocolate and other ingredients)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>EGG MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The egg mixture is a blend of eggs and other ingredients)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla is a flavoring used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>COCA POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cocoa powder is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a key ingredient in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caramel sauce is a topping used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GANACHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ganache is a topping used in the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>BROWNIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brownies are the final product of the recipe)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CAKE TESTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cake tester is used to check if the brownies are done)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RUBBER SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A rubber spatula is used to mix and scrape down the sides of the bowl)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aluminum foil is used to line the pan)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN<|>GEO<|>The kitchen is where the recipe is being prepared)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>FREEZER<|>GEO<|>The freezer is used to chill the brownies)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>REFRIGERATOR<|>GEO<|>The refrigerator is used to chill the brownies)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>GEO<|>A sauce"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
