Preheat the oven to 425°F.\nIn a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients and stir with a whisk to blend. Add the butter and vegetable shortening. Using a pastry cutter, cut the fats into your dry ingredients until the mixture resembles small peas.\nStir in the buttermilk until the dough forms a ball. If the mixture is too dry, stir in the water 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn your dough out onto a work surface dusted with tapioca flour and knead until very smooth, 3 to 4 turns. Form the dough into a disk 1 inch thick. Using a 3-inch-diameter biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits and arrange them in an unbuttered 9-inch cake pan. Bake for 12 to15 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Remove from the oven and transfer the biscuits to wire racks to cool briefly.\nServe hot, with butter, agave syrup, or preserves of your choice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GLUTEN-FREE BUTTERMILK BISCUITS<|>EVENT<|>Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits is a recipe for biscuits that are gluten-free)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Sorghum flour<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sorghum flour is a type of flour used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cornstarch<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cornstarch is a type of flour used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Tapioca flour<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tapioca flour is a type of flour used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Guar gum<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Guar gum is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Kosher salt<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Baking powder<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Unsalted butter<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Vegetable shortening<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable shortening is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Buttermilk<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buttermilk is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Agave syrup<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Agave syrup is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fruit preserves<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fruit preserves is a type of ingredient used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Oven<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of appliance used in Gluten-Free Buttermilk Biscuits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Pastry cutter<|>ORGAN"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
