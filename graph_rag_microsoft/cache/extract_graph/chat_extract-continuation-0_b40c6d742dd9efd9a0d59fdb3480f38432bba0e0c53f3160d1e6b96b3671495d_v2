Add butter and blend, using on/off turns, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 2 tablespoons ice water and blend just until dough begins to clump together, adding more ice water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. Gather dough into ball; flatten into disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 1 hour. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Keep dough chilled. Soften slightly at room temperature before rolling out.\nRoll out dough between sheets of parchment paper to 1/8-inch-thick round, 14 inches in diameter. Remove top sheet of parchment. Using bottom sheet as aid, transfer dough on parchment to large unrimmed baking sheet. Chill 15 minutes.\nPreheat oven to 450°F. Combine apple slices, 2 tablespoons sugar, and lemon peel in medium bowl; toss to blend. Spread preserves over crust, leaving 1 1/2-inch plain border. Arrange apple slices in concentric circles atop preserves, overlapping slightly. Using parchment as aid, fold plain crust border up over apples, pinching any cracks in crust. Brush crust with milk. Sprinkle crust edges and apples with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.\nBake galette 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking until crust is golden, about 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven. Slide long thin knife between parchment and galette. Let stand at least 10 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE GALETTE<|>EVENT<|>Apple Galette is a dessert recipe that combines apples, sugar, and lemon peel in a pastry crust)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>PERSON<|>Apples are a key ingredient in the Apple Galette recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>PERSON<|>Lemon peel is used in the Apple Galette recipe to add flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Sugar is used in the Apple Galette recipe to balance the flavors)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APRICOT PRESERVES<|>PERSON<|>Apricot preserves are used in the Apple Galette recipe to add sweetness and flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>PERSON<|>Whole milk is used in the Apple Galette recipe to brush the crust)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRANNY SMITH APPLES<|>PERSON<|>Granny Smith apples are used in the Apple Galette recipe for their tart flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>GEO<|>Apples are a type of fruit that grows on trees)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>GEO<|>Lemons are a type of citrus fruit that grows on trees)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>GEO<|>Sugar is a sweetener made from sugarcane or sugar beets)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APRICOT PRESERVES<|>GEO<|>Apricot preserves are a type of jam made from apricots)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>GEO<|>Whole milk is a type of dairy product made from cow's milk)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GRANNY SMITH APPLES<|>GEO<|>Granny Smith apples are a type of apple variety known for their tart flavor)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE GALETTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Galette is a dessert recipe developed by an unknown organization)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apples are a type of fruit that are often grown and sold by organizations)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
