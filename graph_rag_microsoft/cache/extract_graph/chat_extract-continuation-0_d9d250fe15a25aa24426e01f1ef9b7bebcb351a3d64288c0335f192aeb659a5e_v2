Dijon mustard', '1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 garlic clove, finely grated', '1 bunch chives, thinly sliced, divided', '¼ small red onion, very thinly sliced through root end', '½ cup sour cream and onion potato chips']\n\nInstructions:\nPlace potatoes in a large pot and pour in 3 qt. water to cover. Add 1 cup salt and bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. (Yes, this is a lot of salt, but it’s the right amount to ensure potatoes are seasoned through and through.) Reduce heat and simmer, adjusting heat as needed, until potatoes until fork-tender, 15–20 minutes. Scoop out ½ cup potato cooking liquid and set aside. Drain potatoes in a colander and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, onion powder, mustard, and pepper in a large bowl and mix well to combine. Add garlic and half of chives and mix just to incorporate.\nPlace red onion in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse for several seconds to take away some of its raw bite. Pat dry with paper towels. Mix half of onion into dressing; set aside remaining onion for serving.\nWorking one at a time, set potatoes on a flat surface and crush slightly with the palm of your hand. Add to bowl with dressing along with ¼ cup potato cooking liquid. Do this while the potatoes are still warm so that they can absorb all of the seasoning. Don't worry if the dressing looks a little loose and watery at the beginning—it will all get absorbed and become creamier as it sits. Taste and season with more salt or, if your dressing looks too thick, a splash of potato cooking liquid.\nTop potatoes with remaining chives and reserved onion and crumble potato chips over.\n", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763438869, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2747, "total_tokens": 3259, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1.
