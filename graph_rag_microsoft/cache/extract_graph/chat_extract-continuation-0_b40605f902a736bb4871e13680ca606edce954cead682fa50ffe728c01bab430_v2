Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool.\nMeanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large ovenproof saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and translucent, 5–8 minutes. Stir in rice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until some grains are translucent, about 5 minutes.\nAdd wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add 2 cups very hot water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and bake in oven until liquid is mostly absorbed but rice is still starchy in the center, 15–18 minutes (it should be undercooked).\nMeanwhile, pulse garlic and half of toasted walnuts in a food processor until very finely ground. Add parsley, chives, half of kale, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/4 cup cold water; process until smooth; season pesto with salt and pepper.\nSet saucepan over medium heat. Add 3/4 cup very hot water and cook rice, stirring constantly, until it is tender but still has some bite and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, butter, three-quarters of Parmesan, and remaining kale. Adjust consistency with water, if needed; season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with remaining walnuts and cheese.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN RISOTTO<|>EVENT<|>Oven Risotto is a dish made with Arborio rice, Parmesan cheese, and kale pesto)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KALE PESTO<|>EVENT<|>Kale Pesto is a sauce made with kale, garlic, and walnuts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TUSCAN KALE<|>GEO<|>Tuscan kale is a type of kale grown in Tuscany, Italy)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ARBORIO RICE<|>GEO<|>Arborio rice is a type of rice grown in the Po Valley, Italy)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARMESAN CHEESE<|>GEO<|>Parmesan cheese is a type of cheese produced in Parma, Italy)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WALNUTS<|>GEO<|>Walnuts are a type of tree nut grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>GEO<|>Olive oil is a type of oil produced from olives, grown in the Mediterranean region)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>GEO<|>Garlic is a type of plant grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>GEO<|>Parsley is a type of herb grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHIVES<|>GEO<|>Chives are a type of herb grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>GEO<|>Onion is a type of plant grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>GEO<|>Butter is a type of dairy product produced from milk, grown in various parts of the world)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person who may be cooking the dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>JOHN<|>PERSON<|>John is a person who may be cooking the dish)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>OVEN RISOTTO<|>KALE PESTO<|>Oven Risotto and Kale Pesto are two components of the same dish<|>9)\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
