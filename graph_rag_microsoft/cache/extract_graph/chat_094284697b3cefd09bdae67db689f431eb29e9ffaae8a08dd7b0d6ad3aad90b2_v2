Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. Turn the broiler to high.\nMEANWHILE, stir together 2 cups of the Gouda, the mayonnaise, sour cream, pickled jalapeños, green onion, and paprika in a large bowl.\nWHEN the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them open lengthwise, scoop out the fluffy insides, and carefully transfer them to the Gouda mixture. Fold gently to combine.\nLAY the empty potato skins on a rimmed baking sheet and evenly distribute the potato filling among the skins, so they are almost overflowing with filling. Top each potato with a generous sprinkling of the remaining shredded Gouda.\nBROIL the potatoes until the cheese is melty and gooey, about 4 minutes. Keep an eye on them so the cheese doesn’t burn. Garnish with more green onions if desired. Serve immediately.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_094284697b3cefd09bdae67db689f431eb29e9ffaae8a08dd7b0d6ad3aad90b2_v2"}
