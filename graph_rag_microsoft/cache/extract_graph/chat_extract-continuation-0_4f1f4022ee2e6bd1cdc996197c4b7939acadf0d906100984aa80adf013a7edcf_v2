Whip the egg whites with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, by hand or by machine, until it holds moderately firm peaks. When the cooked limoncello sponge (or zabaglione) is cooled, scrape about a third of it over the mascarpone, and fold it in with a large rubber spatula. Fold in the rest of the zabaglione in two or three additions. Now fold in the whipped egg whites in several additions, until the limoncello-mascarpone cream is light and evenly blended.\nPour some of the cooled syrup, no deeper than 1/4 inch, into the shallow-rimmed pan to moisten the ladyfingers (savoiardi). One at a time, roll a ladyfinger in the syrup and place it in the casserole or baking dish. Wet each cookie briefly—if it soaks up too much syrup, it will fall apart. Arrange the moistened ladyfingers in neat, tight rows, filling the bottom of the pan completely. You should be able to fit about twenty ladyfingers in a single layer.\nScoop half of the limoncello-mascarpone cream onto the ladyfingers, and smooth it to fill the pan and cover them. Dip and arrange a second layer of ladyfingers in the pan, and cover it completely with the remainder of the cream. Smooth the cream with the spatula, and seal the tiramisù airtight in plastic wrap. Before serving, refrigerate for 6 hours (or up to 2 days), or put it in the freezer for 2 hours. To serve, cut portions of tiramisù in any size you like, and lift each out of the pan onto dessert plates.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>PERSON<|>Egg whites are a type of egg product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mascarpone is a type of Italian cheese used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIMONCELLO<|>EVENT<|>Limoncello is a type of Italian liqueur used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZABAGLIONE<|>EVENT<|>Zabaglione is a type of Italian dessert used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAVOIARDI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Savoiardi is a type of Italian cookie used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LADYFINGERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ladyfingers are a type of Italian cookie used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Syrup is a type of sweet liquid used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIRAMISU<|>EVENT<|>Tiramisu is a type of Italian dessert used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASSEROLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Casserole is a type of baking dish used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING DISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking dish is a type of cooking vessel used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPATULA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spatula is a type of kitchen utensil used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is a type of kitchen utensil used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DESSERT PLATES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dessert plates are a type of tableware used in serving)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>MASCARPONE<|>Egg whites are used to whip with mascarpone in baking<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>LIMONCELLO<|>Mascarpone is used with limoncello in baking<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIMONCELLO<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
