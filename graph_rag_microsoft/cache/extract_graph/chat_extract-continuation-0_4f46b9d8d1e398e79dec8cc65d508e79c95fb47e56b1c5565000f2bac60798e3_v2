If too low, the fish will be oily; if too hot, the pieces will burn.\nFry them until crisp, light golden brown, and floating in the oil, about 2 1/2 minutes per batch. With a fine-mesh skimmer, transfer the fish tempura to the paper-towel-lined plate to absorb the excess oil. Repeat with the remaining pieces of fish. During frying, be sure to remove any pieces of floating batter, or they will burn and darken the oil, which will transfer a burned flavor to the tempura. Serve immediately.\nTo serve, lay the tortillas side by side, open face and overlapping on a platter. Divide the slaw and filling equally between the tortillas and top with salsa and garnish. Grab, fold, and eat right away. Or build your own taco: lay a tortilla, open face, in one hand. Spoon on some slaw, then filling, top with salsa, fold, and eat right away.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FISH<|>PERSON<|>The fish is the main ingredient in the tempura recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPURA<|>EVENT<|>Tempura is a cooking method used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>PERSON<|>The oil is a key ingredient in the tempura recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLAW<|>EVENT<|>Slaw is a topping used in the taco recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TORTILLA<|>EVENT<|>Tortillas are used as the base for the tacos)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALSA<|>EVENT<|>Salsa is a topping used in the taco recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BATTER<|>EVENT<|>Batter is used in the tempura recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH<|>TEMPURA<|>The fish is cooked using the tempura method<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OIL<|>TEMPURA<|>The oil is used in the tempura cooking method<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLAW<|>TORTILLA<|>Slaw is used as a topping on the tortillas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALSA<|>TORTILLA<|>Salsa is used as a topping on the tortillas<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BATTER<|>TEMPURA<|>Batter is used in the tempura cooking method<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH<|>SLAW<|>The fish is served with slaw as a topping<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH<|>SALSA<|>The fish is served with salsa as a topping<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FISH<|>TORTILLA<|>The fish is served on a tortilla<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLAW<|>SALSA<|>Slaw and salsa are both used as toppings<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLAW<|>TORTILLA<|>Slaw is used as a topping on the tortillas<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALSA<|>TORT"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
