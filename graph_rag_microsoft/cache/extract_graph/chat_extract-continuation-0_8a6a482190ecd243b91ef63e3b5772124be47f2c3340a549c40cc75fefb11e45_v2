Warm to form simple syrup, swirling pan to dissolve sugar. Chill before using to make cocktail. The extra syrup will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator.\nBring syrup to a boil with orange zest & cinnamon. Add cranberries, reduce heat to low-medium and cook until all berries have popped. Remove from heat and let steep for a half hour. Pass mixture through the strainer, pressing only gently on the solids with back of ladle or spoon (too much pressure turns the syrup into more of a jelly). Goal is clear, bright, dark pink syrup.\nFollow procedure for syrup EXCEPT stop as soon as a couple of berries start to pop. Chill. Goal is to leave berries intact and just cooked enough to be edible (the remaining syrup is tasty but too weak in cranberry flavor to use in the cocktail).\nFill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add rum, lime juice & cranberry syrup. Shake and serve up in a martini glass, garnished with poached cranberries.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>EVENT<|>Cranberry Daiquiri is a cocktail recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GOSLINGS RUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Goslings is a rum manufacturer)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIME JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime juice is a common ingredient in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRY SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cranberry syrup is a sweetener used in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange zest is a common garnish in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CINNAMON STICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cinnamon stick is a common garnish in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRANBERRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cranberries are a common ingredient in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SIMPLE SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simple syrup is a sweetener used in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a common ingredient in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a common ingredient in cocktails)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>GOSLINGS RUM<|>Goslings rum is used in the Cranberry Daiquiri cocktail<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>LIME JUICE<|>Lime juice is used in the Cranberry Daiquiri cocktail<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>CRANBERRY SYRUP<|>Cranberry syrup is used in the Cranberry Daiquiri cocktail<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>Orange zest is used in the Cranberry Daiquiri cocktail<|>3)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>CRANBERRY DAIQUIRI<|>CINNAMON STICK<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
