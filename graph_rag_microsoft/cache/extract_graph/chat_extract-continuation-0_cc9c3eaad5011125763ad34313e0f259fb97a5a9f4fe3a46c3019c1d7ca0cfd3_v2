Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Butter an 8 x 10-inch (20.3 x 25.4 cm) baking dish. Oil a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Set the pans aside.\n2. To make the marinade: Combine the tomato paste, honey, lemon juice, olive oil, hot sauce, garlic powder, and a pinch or two of salt in a medium bowl. Toss the prawns with the marinade. Set the bowl aside, giving it a stir every few minutes.\n3. For the polenta: Bring 3 cups cold water to a boil in a medium stainless-steel pot. Add the polenta. Cook seven minutes, stirring often. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.\n4. In a large bowl, mix the corn (completely thawed if frozen), currants, honey, butter, and thyme. Stir in the polenta, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5. Add polenta mixture to the buttered baking dish. Spread evenly with a spatula, and place in the oven to bake for 35 minutes.\n6. Spread the prawn mixture evenly onto the oiled baking sheet. After the polenta has baked for 25 minutes, add the prawns to the oven, alongside the polenta. Place both pans on same rack if possible; otherwise, place the baking sheet on the lower rack.\n7. Bake the prawns for five minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and flip all of the prawns\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HONEYED PRAWNS & POLENTA<|>EVENT<|>Recipe for Honeyed Prawns & Polenta, a dish that combines prawns and polenta with various ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONEYED PRAWNS & POLENTA<|>EVENT<|>Recipe for Honeyed Prawns & Polenta, a dish that combines prawns and polenta with various ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HONEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLENTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRAWNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEA SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORN KERNELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRANTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FETA CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed Prawns & Polenta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ingredient used in Honeyed"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
