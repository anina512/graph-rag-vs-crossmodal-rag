Toast buns, cut side down, on a baking sheet until golden brown, about 6 minutes; let cool.\nMeanwhile, cook sugar, rum, orange zest, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 6 minutes. Pluck out and discard orange zest. Add vanilla and let syrup cool slightly. Transfer 1/2 cup syrup to a bowl; reserve the rest for serving.\nWorking one at time, gently dunk and turn brioche in syrup until evenly coated and soaked through, about 30 seconds each. Place on a wire rack set over paper towels; let sit 5 minutes. Repeat dunking process with brioche and let rest 10 minutes (you want them to get sticky).\nBeat cream in a medium bowl to medium-soft peaks. Divide brioche among plates and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Arrange a few figs around and drizzle with a bit of the reserved syrup.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>EVENT<|>Brioche au Rhum is a dessert recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIOSCHE SLIDERS<|>EVENT<|>Brioche sliders are a component of the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARK RUM<|>EVENT<|>Dark rum is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>EVENT<|>Orange zest is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Kosher salt is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla extract is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Heavy cream is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIGS<|>EVENT<|>Figs are an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>BRIOSCHE SLIDERS<|>Brioche sliders are a component of the Brioche au Rhum dessert<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>SUGAR<|>Sugar is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>DARK RUM<|>Dark rum is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>Orange zest is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRIOSCHE AU RHUM<|>KOSHER SALT<|>Kosher salt is an ingredient in the Brioche au Rhum dessert<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
