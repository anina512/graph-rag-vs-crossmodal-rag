Make a crater, pour in the remaining ingredients and 1 cup water, and whisk until all the corners are gotten and the batter is smooth. Put in the oven and start checking for doneness in 20 minutes; the cake should be done at around 30 minutes.\nVanilla ice cream really helps pan cake, and so does chocolate whipped cream frosting. Start with 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate, chopped or chips, and 1 pint whipping cream. Put all the chocolate and about 1/2 cup of the cream in a medium mixing bowl and heat over simmering water until the chocolate has melted. Remove from the heat and whisk in the rest of the cream and 1 or 2 teaspoons sugar. Refrigerate until well chilled and then whip until thick and smooth. Be sure the cake is completely cooled before spreading on. If it's a warm day and you're not eating the cake right away, refrigerate it or the chocolate cream will melt right off.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Pan Cake is a type of cake that can be made with a variety of ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>EVENT<|>Ingredients are the components used to make the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>EVENT<|>Flour is a key ingredient in making the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is a key ingredient in making the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COCA<|>EVENT<|>Cocoa is a key ingredient in making the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>EVENT<|>Vegetable oil is a key ingredient in making the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla ice cream is a topping for the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE WHIPPED CREAM FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate whipped cream frosting is a topping for the Pan Cake)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE<|>EVENT<|>Semisweet chocolate is a key ingredient in making the chocolate whipped cream frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHIPPING CREAM<|>EVENT<|>Whipping cream is a key ingredient in making the chocolate whipped cream frosting)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>INGREDIENTS<|>Pan Cake is made with a variety of ingredients<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>FLOUR<|>Pan Cake is made with flour<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>SUGAR<|>Pan Cake is made with sugar<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>COCA<|>Pan Cake is made with cocoa<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>Pan Cake is made with vegetable oil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE<|>VANILLA ICE CREAM<|>Pan Cake is often served with vanilla ice cream<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PAN CAKE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
