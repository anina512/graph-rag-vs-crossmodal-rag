Cook onion, garlic, and thyme, stirring, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add celery and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are cooked through, about 3 minutes more. Transfer mixture to a large bowl; remove thyme sprigs. Add bread and pecans, toss to combine, and set aside.\nPour stock and wine into hot skillet and heat over medium-high, scraping up browned bits with a spoon; season with 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. Cook, stirring, until just combined, about 1 minute. Pour over bread mixture, then toss to combine.\nWhisk soy sauce, maple syrup, paprika, cayenne, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl.\nBreak tofu into large chunks. Working in batches, break up tofu with your hands and press down into a towel-lined colander to drain as much water as possible. Bring ends of towel together, gathering tofu into the middle, and squeeze towel into a ball to expel as much water as possible. Transfer tofu to a food processor. Add miso, cornstarch, garlic powder, and remaining 2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. Blend until smooth, about 30 seconds.\nUsing an oiled spatula, line bottom and interior sides of prepared pan with two-thirds of the tofu mixture, pressing firmly to create compact 3/4\"-high walls. Spoon mushroom mixture into the center and press down firmly. Cover with remaining tofu mixture; smooth surface. (If you have leftover stuffing, bake remaining stuffing in a covered dish separately and serve as a side dish.) Using a pastry brush, brush top generously with soy-maple glaze.\nTransfer pan to a rimmed baking sheet and bake tofurkey, brushing top with glaze halfway through, until loaf is set and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Line another rimmed baking sheet with parchment and place over oval pan. Quickly but carefully invert pan to turn out tofurkey onto sheet, using parchment to gently\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PAN<|>GEO<|>pan, leaving a 1\" overhang)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread is a type of baked food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pecans are a type of nut)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>PERSON<|>Onion is a type of vegetable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is a type of vegetable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>PERSON<|>Thyme is a type of herb)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mushrooms are a type of fungus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Celery is a type of vegetable)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>GEO<|>Skillet is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oil is a type of cooking ingredient)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stock is a type of cooking liquid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wine is a type of beverage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOFU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tofu is a type of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Soy sauce is a type of condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPLE SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Maple syrup is a type of sweetener)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAPRIKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paprika is a type of spice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAYENNE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cayenne is a type of spice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOWEL<|>GEO<|>Towel is a type of household item)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD PROCESSOR<|>GEO<|>Food processor is a type of kitchen appliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MISO<|>ORGANIZATION<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
