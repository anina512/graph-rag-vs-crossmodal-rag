The coating should be about 3 inches deep for easier dipping. (I usually work with about 16 ounces of coating at a time.)\nWhen you are ready to dip, remove a few cake balls at a time from the refrigerator, keeping the rest chilled.\nOne at a time, dip about 1/2 inch of the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted candy coating, and insert the stick straight into a cake ball, pushing it no more than halfway through. Dip the cake pop into the melted coating, and tap off any excess coating. Hold the pop over the bowl in one hand, and tap your wrist gently with your other hand. If you use the hand holding the cake pop to shake off excess coating, the force of the movement will be too strong and could cause the cake ball to loosen or fly off the lollipop stick. Tapping the wrist holding the cake pop absorbs some of the impact. The excess coating will fall off, but you will need to rotate the lollipop stick so the coating doesn't build up on one side, making it too heavy on that side. If too much coating starts to build up at the base of the stick, simply use your finger to wipe it off, spinning the lollipop stick at the same time. This can happen if the coating is too thin or too hot. It's not as hard as it sounds; it just takes a little practice.\nLet dry in a Styrofoam block.\nPour the remaining purple coating into a large squeeze bottle, and pipe random, drizzled lines all around the monster head. Let dry completely in the Styrofoam block.\nOn some of the pops, pipe two small white circles with a candy writer for the eyes, and insert 2 chocolate jimmies before the coating sets.\nOn the remaining pops, pipe a single large, white circle. Let dry completely and draw a large blue circle inside the white\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MONSTER POPS<|>EVENT<|>Monster Pops is a recipe for making cake pops with a monster theme)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE BALLS<|>EVENT<|>Cake balls are the base of the Monster Pops recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PURPLE CANDY COATING<|>EVENT<|>Purple candy coating is used to dip the cake pops in the Monster Pops recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOLLIPOP STICKS<|>EVENT<|>Lollipop sticks are used to hold the cake pops in the Monster Pops recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STYROFOAM BLOCK<|>EVENT<|>Styrofoam block is used to hold the Monster Pops in place while they dry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE CANDY WRITER<|>EVENT<|>White candy writer is used to draw eyes on some of the Monster Pops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE JIMMIES<|>EVENT<|>Chocolate jimmies are used to add details to some of the Monster Pops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUE EDIBLE-INK PEN<|>EVENT<|>Blue edible-ink pen is used to draw details on some of the Monster Pops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK EDIBLE-INK PEN<|>EVENT<|>Black edible-ink pen is used to draw details on some of the Monster Pops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSTER POPS<|>EVENT<|>Monster Pops is a recipe for making cake pops with a monster theme)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE BALLS<|>MONSTER POPS<|>Cake balls are the base of the Monster Pops recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PURPLE CANDY COATING<|>MONSTER POPS<|>Purple candy coating is used to dip the cake pops in the Monster Pops recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOLLIPOP STICKS<|>MONSTER POPS<|>Lollipop sticks are used to hold the cake pops in the Monster Pops recipe<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STYROFOAM BLOCK<|>MONSTER POPS<|>Styrofoam block is used to hold the Monster Pops in place while they"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
