(If mixture doesn’t foam, start over with new yeast.) Add oil, salt, and 1 cup flour and stir until a dough forms (it should be soft but not sticky), adding more flour a little at a time, if necessary.\nTurn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding just enough flour to surface to keep dough from sticking, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 400°F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Oil 2 large baking sheets.\nPunch down dough, then roll out on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch square. Lightly brush dough with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds, pressing to help them adhere. Cut dough into very thin strips (about 1/4-inch wide) with a pizza wheel or sharp knife.\nDivide strips between baking sheets, scattering them loosely in a free-form pattern (strips may overlap). Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through, until crisp and golden-brown in spots, 10 to 15 minutes (if breadsticks begin to get too dark in spots, cover area with foil.) Transfer to racks to cool, about 10 minutes.\nBreadsticks can be made up to 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Reheat if desired before serving.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
