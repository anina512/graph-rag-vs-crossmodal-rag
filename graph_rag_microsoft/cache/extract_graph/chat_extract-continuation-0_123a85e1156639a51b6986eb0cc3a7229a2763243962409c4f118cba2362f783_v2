Strain and pat dry with a paper towel.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Submerge the eggs and boil for 6 minutes. Strain and peel the eggs under cold running water.\nThinly slice 1 carrot and cut the slices into thin julienne.\nPeel the tough outer leaves from the leeks and halve them lengthwise, starting 1/2 inch from their base to keep them intact. Rinse them with cold water to wash any sand from their layers. Bunch the leeks and tie together with butcher's twine. Place in a large pot with the remaining carrots, the bay leaf, and thyme and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Strain, and discard the thyme and bay leaf.\nTransfer the carrots to a blender with 5 tablespoons water, the mustard, and vinegar. Puree until smooth, then stream in the olive oil until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper.\nUntie the leeks, pat dry with paper towels, and brush them with carrot dressing; sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nIn a large sauté pan over medium heat, sear the bacon on both sides until crispy, about 6 minutes total. Strain off all but 1 tablespoon fat, transfer the bacon to a cutting board, and cut the strips crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces. Season the chicken livers on all sides with salt and pepper. Return the sauté pan with the bacon fat to high heat and add the livers in a single layer.
