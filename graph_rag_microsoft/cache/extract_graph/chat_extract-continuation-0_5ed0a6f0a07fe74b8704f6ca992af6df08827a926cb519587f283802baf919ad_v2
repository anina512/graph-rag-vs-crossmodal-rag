Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat; cover and let steep 20 minutes. If necessary, rewarm milk until instant-read thermometer inserted into mixture registers between 105°F and 115°F before continuing.\nBlend sugar and lemon peel in processor. Mix 1 1/2 cups flour and yeast in bowl of heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Discard vanilla bean and add warm milk to bowl; beat to blend. Let stand until slightly puffed, about 15 minutes. Add 3 cups flour, eggs, and brandy to yeast mixture; beat on medium speed until smooth and slightly firm dough forms, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is sticky or adding water by tablespoonfuls if dough is dry, about 6 minutes. Add sugar-lemon peel mixture and salt. Beat on medium speed 5 minutes. Add butter and beat until absorbed and dough is smooth and soft, about 5 minutes longer. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\nGenerously butter 12-cup Bundt pan. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface; knead gently into ball. Using fingers, make hole in center of dough, creating doughnut shape. Transfer to prepared pan, pushing hole in dough over center tube in pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight (dough will rise to top of pan).\nLet dough rise in warm draft-free area until dough no longer springs back when gently pressed with fingers, about 1 hour 30 minutes (dough will rise above pan by 1 to 1\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
