Line a 9x5\" loaf pan with parchment, leaving overhang on long sides; coat with nonstick spray (to use an 8 1/2x4 1/2\" pan, hold back 1 cup batter). Toast shredded coconut on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, 5–7 minutes. Let cool.\nWhisk rice flour, sorghum flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and xanthan gum in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat sugar, coconut milk, oil, and coconut extract, if using, in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat mixture until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low; beat in dry ingredients. Increase speed to medium; beat batter 5 minutes. Beat in toasted coconut. Scrape batter into prepared pan; top with coconut flakes.\nBake bread until top springs back when gently pressed and a tester inserted all the way to the bottom comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 80–95 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 10 minutes. Turn out bread onto rack and let cool completely.\nBread can be baked 4 days ahead.
