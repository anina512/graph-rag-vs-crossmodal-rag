Line the bottom of a broiler pan with foil for easier clean-up, if you like, then top with the broiler rack. Put the meat on the broiler rack, lightly coat with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Broil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (err on the side of caution with the time; you can always cook it more). Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with salt, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, mint, and cilantro.*\nCut the meat against the grain into very thin slices and add to the bowl. (If the meat is still hot, wait a few minutes until it is warm or it will wilt the lettuce and herbs.) Drizzle the salad with just enough Chile-Lime Sauce to lightly coat and gently toss together. Top with the peanuts, if you like.\nPrepare to *, then cover and refrigerate the lettuce mixture and the unsliced meat separately for up to 1 day. The meat can be sliced and added to the salad cold or you can warm it in a 300°F (150°C) oven, if you prefer.\nIf the salad will be served within 1 hour or so, cover the lettuce mixture and meat separately and leave them on the counter. People can help themselves and then toss their individual portions with the dressing.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e2b53c0829a1dc80df937e03c30e3be62ac19f51ee5d02c3923611e68d528e7f_v2"}
