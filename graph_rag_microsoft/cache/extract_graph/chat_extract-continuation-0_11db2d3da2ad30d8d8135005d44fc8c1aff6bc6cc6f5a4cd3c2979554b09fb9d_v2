Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 275°F. Line a small rimmed baking sheet or pie pan with foil. Sprinkle baking soda, if using, onto sheet and bake 1 hour. Let cool.\nFill a small stainless steel pot or skillet (not aluminum, copper, or nonstick) with 1 cup water. Add baking soda and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve baking soda. Let cool.\nPeel, core, and slice apples into 1/4\"-thick wedges. Transfer apples to a large pot and add sugar, all-purpose flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, kosher salt, and 1/4 cup water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are softened but still have a little bite, 15-20 minutes. If bottom starts to brown, reduce heat to medium-low and add water, 1 Tbsp. at a time. Let cool to room temperature.\nPreheat oven to 450°F. Butter a 10\" cast-iron skillet. Punch down dough on an unfloured surface to deflate, then divide in half (an easy way to do this is to use a scale and divide by weight). Return one half to greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap while you work on the other piece.\nUsing a rolling pin, roll dough to a 13\" circle. Settle into prepared skillet and let dough relax into pan, just coming up and over the edge slightly. If it shrinks, stretch it by hand to create an even rim. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until increased in size by about 50%, 20–30 minutes.\nDivide second piece of dough into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces on a rimmed baking sheet covered with plastic, roll on an unfloured surface to form 1 (36\"-long) rope. Arrange rope in a U-shape with ends pointing away from you. Holding an end in each hand, cross ends, then fold them down toward you to create a pretzel shape about 11\" wide. Return to rimmed baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Roll remaining 2 pieces to form 2 more (36\"-long) ropes. Twist ropes tightly around each\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>OBJECT<|>A bowl is a kitchen container used for mixing and serving food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>OBJECT<|>Plastic wrap is a type of kitchen wrap used to cover food and prevent it from drying out)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WARM PLACE<|>GEO<|>A warm place is a location with a suitable temperature for dough to rise)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>OBJECT<|>An oven is a kitchen appliance used for baking and cooking food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>OBJECT<|>A baking sheet is a flat, rectangular pan used for baking food in the oven)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE PAN<|>OBJECT<|>A pie pan is a type of baking dish used for baking pies and other desserts)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FOIL<|>OBJECT<|>Foil is a type of kitchen wrap used to line baking sheets and prevent food from sticking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>OBJECT<|>Baking soda is a type of baking powder used to help baked goods rise)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SMALL RIMMED BAKING SHEET<|>OBJECT<|>A small rimmed baking sheet is a type of baking sheet used for baking small quantities of food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SMALL STAINLESS STEEL POT<|>OBJECT<|>A small stainless steel pot is a type of cooking pot used for heating and cooking food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SKILLET<|>OBJECT<|>A skillet is a type of cooking pan used for heating and cooking food)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>LIQUID<|>Water is a clear, colorless liquid used for cooking and cleaning)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>APPLES<|>FOOD<|>Apples are a type of fruit used in baking and cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>FOOD<|>Sugar is a type of sweetener used in baking and cooking)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>FOOD<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used for baking and"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
