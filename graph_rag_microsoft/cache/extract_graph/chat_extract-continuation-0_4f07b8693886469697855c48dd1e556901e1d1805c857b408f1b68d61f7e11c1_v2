Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk cornstarch and sea salt in a small bowl, breaking up any lumps. Mix ginger, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and 1 Tbsp. cinnamon in another small bowl.\nUsing an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft, opaque peaks form, about 3 minutes. You should see tracks from the whisk on the surface of the whites.\nAdd superfine sugar slowly, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating to incorporate fully before adding the next, 5–8 minutes total. Continue to beat on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 1 minute more. Test to see if sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a small amount between your fingertips. If it feels gritty, keep beating until dissolved.\nSprinkle cornstarch mixture over egg whites and fold in gently with a spatula. Sift spices over mixture with a fine-mesh strainer and fold in gently.\nUsing a large spoon, divide meringue into 8 even mounds on prepared baking sheets. Using the back of the spoon, make a small well in the center of each meringue. Using fine-mesh strainer, lightly dust with remaining 1 tsp. cinnamon.\nBake 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250°F.
