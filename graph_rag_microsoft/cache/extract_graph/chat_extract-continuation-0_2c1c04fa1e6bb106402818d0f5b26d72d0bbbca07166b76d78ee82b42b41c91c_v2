If using dough log, cut into 20 equal-size rounds. Arrange sliced dough rounds (or 20 pre-portioned rounds) on 2 baking sheets, spacing evenly. Using fingertips, press each into 2 1/2-inch round. Bake cookies until golden, about 11 minutes for sliced rounds and 15 minutes for pre-portioned dough. Transfer to rack; cool.\nLine baking sheet with foil; place in freezer. Place 1 cookie, flat side up, on work surface. Top with 1/3 cup ice cream; spread almost to edge. Top with single layer of bananas. Sandwich with another cookie; press gently to compact. Place on baking sheet in freezer. Repeat with remaining cookies, ice cream, and bananas. Freeze 2 hours. Using knife, smooth sides of ice cream sandwiches. Freeze 1 hour.\nPlace chocolate chips and oil in small glass bowl; microwave on medium-high until chocolate is melted, stopping occasionally to stir, about 1 1/2 minutes. Let stand just until cool, about 10 minutes.\nPlace granola or toffee (if using) on plate. Dip 1 ice cream sandwich halfway into melted chocolate; lift and quickly shake excess chocolate back into bowl. If desired, roll dipped edge in granola or toffee; return to baking sheet in freezer. Repeat with remaining sandwiches, chocolate, and granola or toffee. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 days ahead. Wrap each sandwich in foil; keep frozen.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is a type of cookie dough used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANA ICE CREAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Banana Ice Cream is a type of ice cream used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANOLA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Granola is a type of topping used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLISH TOFFEE BITS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>English Toffee Bits is a type of topping used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chocolate Chips is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable Oil is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bananas is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COOKIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cookies is a type of baked good used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE CREAM SANDWICHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ice Cream Sandwiches is a type of dessert used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH<|>PERSON<|>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is a type of cookie dough used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANA ICE CREAM<|>PERSON<|>Banana Ice Cream is a type of ice cream used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRANOLA<|>PERSON<|>Granola is a type of topping used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLISH TOFFEE BITS<|>PERSON<|>English Toffee Bits is a type of topping used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>PERSON<|>Chocolate Chips is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Vegetable Oil is a type of ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BANANAS<|>PERSON<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
