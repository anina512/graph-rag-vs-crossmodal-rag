Transfer to a bowl.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce, if using: In a glass measure, whisk together the hot sauce, maple syrup, lime juice, salt, and cayenne pepper to taste. Microwave the mixture for 1 minute or until fairly hot, or whisk the mixture together in a small saucepan and place it over direct heat on the grill until it is hot, 4 to 5 minutes, or longer depending on the grill. Add the mixture to the seitan bowl and stir gently to combine, or coat the seitan if it is skewered. Finish with the optional oregano.
