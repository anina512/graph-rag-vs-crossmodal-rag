Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\nPrepare the meringue cookie batter as directed. Using a piping bag with a 1/2-inch plain tip, or using a spoon, form the meringue into three 8-inch disks on the lined baking sheets, each about 1/2 inch thick.\nBake for about 45 minutes, until crisp on the outside but still moist in the center. Cool completely in the oven.\nHalve the pineapple lengthwise and cut the pieces crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Heat a very thin layer of oil in large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and add the pineapple. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until seared and golden, then flip the pieces and sear the other side. Transfer the pieces to a plate and sprinkle them lightly with salt; cool to room temperature.\nWhip the cream until soft peaks form; sift the confectioners' sugar over it and whip until combined and the cream forms medium-firm peaks. Put the pastry cream in a large bowl and whisk to loosen it.\nAdd about a third of the whipped cream and whisk it into the pastry cream to lighten it. Using a large spatula, add the remaining whipped cream and fold it into the pastry cream until just combined. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the cream and transfer the remainder to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip.\nPut one meringue disk onto a serving plate and pipe a spiral of pastry cream (using a little less than half of it) over it, covering it completely but leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge. Blot the pineapple pieces with a paper towel and arrange half of them, fanning them in a concentric circle, over the pastry cream.
