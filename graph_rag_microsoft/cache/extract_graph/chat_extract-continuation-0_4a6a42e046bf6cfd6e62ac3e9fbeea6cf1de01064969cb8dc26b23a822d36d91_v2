Place porcini and wine in small saucepan. Bring to simmer over low heat; remove from heat. Let soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer porcini to work surface and coarsely chop. Line strainer with damp paper towel; strain wine into small bowl and reserve.\nMelt butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add crimini and shiitakes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until brown, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add shallot and stir until soft, about 1 minute. Add chopped porcini and strained wine. Boil until almost dry, about 1 minute. Stir in thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cool.\nRemove Brie from box, discarding lid and paper. Using sharp knife, cut top rind from Brie; discard. Return Brie to box. (Alternatively, stack two 12-inch rounds of foil and fold up around bottom and sides of Brie, crimping foil at edges, leaving top exposed.) Mound mushroom mixture atop Brie. DO AHEAD: Can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before continuing.\nPreheat oven to 350°F. Place Brie with mushrooms on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until cheese begins to melt and mushrooms are warmed through, about 15 minutes. Transfer Brie in box to plate. Serve hot with baguette slices.\n*Available in the produce section of many supermarkets and at specialty foods stores and Italian markets.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BAKED BRIE WITH MUSHROOMS AND THYME<|>EVENT<|>Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme is a recipe that combines the flavors of Brie cheese, mushrooms, and thyme)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKED BRIE<|>EVENT<|>Baked Brie is a dish that involves baking Brie cheese in the oven)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Mushrooms are a key ingredient in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>EVENT<|>Thyme is a herb used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PORCINI MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Porcini mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CRIMINI MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Crimini mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Shiitake mushrooms are a type of mushroom used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BAKETTE<|>EVENT<|>Baguette is a type of bread used to serve with the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RED WINE<|>EVENT<|>Red wine is an ingredient used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>EVENT<|>Butter is an ingredient used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALLOT<|>EVENT<|>Shallot is an ingredient used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BRIE<|>EVENT<|>Brie is a type of cheese used in the Baked Brie with Mushrooms and Thyme recipe)\n##\n## (\"relationship\"<|>BAKED BRIE"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
