Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 1/2 hours.\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over high heat until it shimmers. Sear pineapple in 2 batches, turning once, until well blackened, about 6 minutes per batch, adding remaining tablespoon oil between batches. Transfer to paper towels to drain and cool briefly, then cut pineapple into 1/4-inch pieces, discarding core.\nWhisk together lime zest, lime juice, rum, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in pineapple and chill until ready to use.\nBring sugar and water to a boil in a 10-inch heavy skillet, stirring until sugar has dissolved, then wash down any sugar crystals from side of skillet with a pastry brush dipped in cold water. Boil, without stirring, swirling pan occasionally, until dark amber, 7 to 8 minutes. Cool 2 minutes, then whisk in butter, cream, and yogurt. Transfer to a bowl and chill.\nPreheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle.\nRoll out dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into an 11-inch round (about 1/8 inch thick), then fit into tart pan. Trim excess dough flush with rim, then press side to make dough come up slightly above rim. Lightly prick bottom all over with a fork, then chill 30 minutes.\nLine tart shell with foil and fill with pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet until side is set and edge is pale golden, about 15 minutes. Carefully remove foil and weights and continue to bake until pale golden all over, about 25 minutes more, loosely covering edges with foil if they get too dark. Cool shell in tart pan 15 minutes.\nReduce oven temperature to 350°F.\nWhisk together eggs, yolks, and sugar in a large bowl, then whisk in remaining ingredients. Transfer filling to tart shell and bake until a light crust forms on top and filling is set 3 inches from edge but center is still wobbly, 45 to 50 minutes (filling will be slightly puffed and will continue to set as it cools).\nServe slightly warm or at room temperature, topped with pineapple salsa and drizzled with caramel sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients used to make a variety of baked goods)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE WEIGHTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pie weights are small metal or ceramic objects used to weigh down the dough in a pie crust)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PIE PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pie pan is a type of baking dish used to make pies and tarts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CARAMEL SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Caramel sauce is a sweet and sticky sauce made from sugar and cream)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PINEAPPLE SALSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pineapple salsa is a sweet and tangy sauce made from pineapple, lime juice, and spices)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIME ZEST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime zest is the grated skin of a lime, used to add flavor and texture to dishes)\n## (\"entity\"<|>LIME JUICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lime juice is the juice of a lime, used to add flavor and acidity to dishes)\n## (\"entity\"<|>RUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rum is a type of spirit made from sugarcane byproducts)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brown sugar is a type of sugar that has been cooked to caramelize it)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a sweet, white or brown crystalline substance used as a food ingredient)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Water is a clear, colorless, and odorless liquid used as a food ingredient)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of food made from the reproductive cells of birds)\n## (\"entity\"<|>YOLKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yolks are the yellow part of an egg, used as a food ingredient)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Flour is a type of powder made from ground grains, used as a food ingredient)\n## (\"entity\"<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
