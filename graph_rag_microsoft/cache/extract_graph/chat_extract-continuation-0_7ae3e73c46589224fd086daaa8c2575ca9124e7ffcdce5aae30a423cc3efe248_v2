Cover and grill, turning once halfway through, until beans are lightly charred and crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. If using grill pan, cook beans directly on pan, tossing occasionally, until well charred and cooked through, about 10 minutes.\nRemove tofu from marinade, reserving marinade, and transfer to a plate; pat dry. Brush grill and tofu with oil and grill tofu, turning once halfway through, until lightly charred, 2–3 minutes per side. If using grill, be careful when turning, as tofu may stick.
