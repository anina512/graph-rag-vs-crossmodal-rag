Let soak 20 minutes. Drain, rinse, and pat dry. Coarsely chop.\nWhisk capers, mayonnaise, oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, mustard, and garlic in a medium bowl; taste and season with salt and more lemon juice, if desired.\nShape lamb into 4 patties about 1\" thick, season with salt, and let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet, ideally cast iron, over medium. Cook lamb patties, working in batches if needed, until browned (they won’t take on as much color as a beef burger), 5–7 minutes. Turn and cook until browned on second side, about 5 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer patties to a plate and let rest 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, toss celery, fennel, fennel fronds (if using), onion, lemon juice, dried mint, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Season slaw with salt and pepper.\nGenerously spread aioli on cut sides of buns and build each burger with a lamb patty, 3 or 4 boquerones, and a mound of slaw. This is a messy burger, so the bib is not optional.\nAioli can be made\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_c84c8bc6f4837cf9ea39902fec51b0f43f90213dd65961a63d3008951fce2c64_v2"}
