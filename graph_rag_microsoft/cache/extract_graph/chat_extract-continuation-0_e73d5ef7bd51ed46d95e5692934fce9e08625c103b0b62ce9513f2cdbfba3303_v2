Place an oven rack in the lower-center position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Set a large V-shaped roasting rack inside a shallow roasting pan.\n2. Pulse the shallots, garlic, chiles, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a food processor until finely chopped. With the food processor running, add the butter, one piece at time, and process until a paste forms.\n3. In a large bowl, crumble the tamales and using a fork, stir in the corn. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Pat the turkey dry. Using metal skewers or toothpicks, secure the neck skin to the back of the turkey, then tuck the turkey's wings behind its back.\n5. Stuff the tamale mixture into the turkey's cavity and tie the legs together with butcher's twine. Place the turkey in the prepared rack, breast up, and rub with the butter mixture. Cover the turkey loosely with foil and roast for 1 hour, basting with pan drippings every 20 minutes.\n6. Uncover and roast for 30 to 45 minutes, until the skin is well browned and an instant-read thermometer registers 175°F in the thighs and drumsticks and 165°F in the breast and stuffing.\n7. Transfer the turkey to a serving platter or carving board and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving.\n8. Carve the turkey and serve with the tamale stuffing.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TEXAS TAMALE-STUFFED TURKEY<|>EVENT<|>Francis Butler's Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey is a recipe for a dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCIS BUTLER<|>PERSON<|>Francis Butler is the author of the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHALLOTS<|>GEO<|>Shallots are a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>GEO<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JALAPEÑO CHILES<|>GEO<|>Jalapeño chiles are a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>GEO<|>Kosher salt is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER<|>GEO<|>Freshly ground black pepper is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>GEO<|>Unsalted butter is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PORK TAMALES<|>GEO<|>Pork tamales are a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICKEN TAMALES<|>GEO<|>Chicken tamales are a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILE TAMALES<|>GEO<|>Chile tamales are a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORN<|>GEO<|>Corn is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE TURKEY<|>GEO<|>Whole turkey is a type of ingredient used in the Texas Tamale-Stuffed Turkey recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANCIS BUTLER<|"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
