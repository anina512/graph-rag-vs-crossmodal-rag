Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C, and place one rack in the center and one rack in the top third of the oven. Line the baking sheets with parchment paper.\n2. Shape the brioche dough into a rectangle about 8 in/20 cm long, 4 in/10 cm wide, and 1 in/2.5 cm thick. Using a ruler and a knife, cut the rectangle into eight 2-in/5-cm squares by first dividing it in half horizontally and then dividing it vertically into strips 2 in/5 cm wide. Each square of dough should weigh about 3 1/2 oz/100 g. Stretch each square into a circle about 5 in/12 cm in diameter as if you are making a small pizza. Stretch the inner part of the circle so that it is quite thin and shape the edge of the circle to create a rim. The center should be almost paper-thin, and the finished circle should look like you are making the crust for a mini deep-dish pizza. Place the brioche circle on one of the prepared baking sheets and repeat with the remaining dough squares, spacing them 2 to 3 in/5 to 7.5 cm apart and using both baking sheets.\n3. Using the back of a spoon, spread 1 tbsp of the crème fraîche over the base of each brioche circle, spreading it evenly over the base but leaving the rim bare. Cut the bacon slices in half. For each pizza, press three half slices of bacon against the brioche rim to create a bacon wall. Divide the caramelized onions evenly among the pizzas, spooning and spreading the onions next to the bacon and leaving the center of the circle bare except for the crème fraîche.\n4. Bake the pizzas, switching the baking sheets between the racks and rotating them back to front about halfway during baking, for about 15 minutes, or until the edges of the pizza\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BREAKFAST PIZZAS<|>EVENT<|>Breakfast Pizzas is a recipe for a breakfast dish)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BASIC BRIOCHE DOUGH<|>EVENT<|>Basic Brioche dough is a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>EVENT<|>Crème fraîche is a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THICK-CUT APPLEWOOD-SMOKED BACON<|>EVENT<|>Thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon is a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARAMELIZED ONIONS<|>EVENT<|>Caramelized onions are a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>EVENT<|>Eggs are a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOZZARELLA CHEESE<|>EVENT<|>Mozzarella cheese is a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIOCHE DOUGH<|>EVENT<|>Brioche dough is a component of the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEETS<|>EVENT<|>Baking sheets are used in the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>EVENT<|>Oven is used in the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RULER<|>EVENT<|>Ruler is used in the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNIFE<|>EVENT<|>Knife is used in the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>EVENT<|>Parchment paper is used in the Breakfast Pizzas recipe)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAKFAST PIZZAS<|>BASIC BRIOCHE DOUGH<|>Breakfast Pizzas recipe includes Basic Brioche dough as a component<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAKFAST PIZZAS<|>CRÈME FRAÎCHE<|>Breakfast Pizzas recipe includes crème fraîche as a component<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREAKFAST PIZZ"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
