With your fist, push a bowl shape in the middle of the ground meat. Take a handful of crackers and crumble them by hand into the bowl shape in the beef. Beat the eggs and add them on top of the crackers, then pour in the milk. Season with a few shakes of salt and pepper and mix everything together with your hands.\nSauté peppers and onions in a small pan with about a teaspoon of butter or olive oil until just tender, about five minutes. Add about a third of this to the meatloaf mixture and set the rest aside for the gravy.\nIn a separate bowl or plate, crush a generous handful or so of the crackers. Form two large or three small loaves out of the meatloaf mixture and roll each in crushed crackers to coat. Melt about a teaspoon of butter in a large, deep pan and brown meatloaves over medium heat for about ten minutes. Flip each loaf with a long spatula to brown the other side, covering with lid both times.\nWhile loaves are browning on the second side, sauté sliced mushrooms in a small pan in a teaspoon of butter or olive oil for about five minutes. In a medium-sized pot, combine a large can of diced tomatoes, a jar of your favorite prepared spaghetti sauce, the mushrooms, and the rest of the sautéed peppers and onions. Stir and let simmer for a few minutes, then add to meatloaves. Cover pan, turn heat down to low, and let loaves cook through, about an hour. Serve with blanched green beans and white rice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MOM'S MEATLOAF<|>EVENT<|>Meatloaf recipe with ground beef, crackers, eggs, milk, peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and tomato sauce)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GROUND BEEF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ground beef is a type of meat used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALTINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Saltines are a type of cracker used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Milk is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN PEPPERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Green peppers are a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Onions are a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTON MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Button mushrooms are a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CHOPPED TOMATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chopped tomatoes are a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>TOMATO SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato sauce is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pepper is a type of ingredient used in the meatloaf recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
