Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.\nIn small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over cream. Let stand until gelatin softens, about 1 minute.\nMeanwhile, in medium saucepan over moderate heat, whisk together milk and sugar. Scrape in seeds from vanilla beans; add beans. Heat, whisking occasionally, until sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in cream mixture. Strain through fine-mesh sieve, discarding vanilla beans, then ladle mixture into 8 (4-ounce) ramekins. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.\nIn heavy medium saucepan over moderate heat, combine 1/2 cup water and pear mixture. Bring to simmer, uncovered, and cook until pears are tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer mixture to food processor and purée until smooth. Transfer jam to medium bowl, cover tightly, and refrigerate until cool, about 1 hour. (Jam will keep, covered, in refrigerator up to 1 week.)\nRun thin sharp knife around inside edge of each ramekin to loosen. Dip bottom of 1 ramekin in bowl of very warm water 6 seconds. Put plate over ramekin, then invert panna cotta onto plate, gently lifting off ramekin. Repeat to unmold remaining panna cottas. Top each with 1/4 cup pear jam and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VANILLA PANNA COTTA<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla Panna Cotta is a dessert made with cream, sugar, and vanilla beans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAR JAM<|>EVENT<|>Pear Jam is a sweet spread made from pears and sugar)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARTLETT PEARS<|>GEO<|>Bartlett pears are a variety of pear commonly used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BEANS<|>GEO<|>Vanilla beans are the seed pods of the vanilla orchid, used to flavor desserts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>GEO<|>Heavy cream is a type of dairy product used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>GEO<|>Whole milk is a type of dairy product used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNFLAVORED POWDERED GELATIN<|>GEO<|>Unflavored powdered gelatin is a type of gelatin used in cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Smith is a fictional person who might be making this dessert)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA PANNA COTTA<|>PEAR JAM<|>Vanilla Panna Cotta is often served with Pear Jam<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL SMITH<|>VANILLA PANNA COTTA<|>Samuel Smith might be making Vanilla Panna Cotta for a special occasion<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL SMITH<|>PEAR JAM<|>Samuel Smith might be making Pear Jam to go with Vanilla Panna Cotta<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BARTLETT PEARS<|>PEAR JAM<|>Bartlett pears are used to make Pear Jam<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BEANS<|>VANILLA PANNA COTTA<|>Vanilla beans are used to flavor Vanilla Panna Cotta<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAVY CREAM<|>VANILLA PANNA COTTA<|>Heavy cream is"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
