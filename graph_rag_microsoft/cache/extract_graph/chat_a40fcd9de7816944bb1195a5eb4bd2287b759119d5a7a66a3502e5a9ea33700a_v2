Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Identify all entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform entity recognition on the text. We'll define a custom entity recognition model that includes the entity types specified in the problem (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.util import filter_spans\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognition model\ndef custom_entity_recognition(doc):\n    # Define the entity types\n    entity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n    # Define the entity patterns\n    patterns = [\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORGANIZATION\", \"LOWER\": \"techglobal\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\", \"LOWER\": \"samuel namara\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GEO\", \"LOWER\": \"aurelia\"},\n        {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"EVENT\", \"LOWER\": \"brined roast turkey breast\"},\n    ]\n\n    # Create a matcher\n    matcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n\n    # Add the patterns to the matcher\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", None, pattern)\n\n    # Get the matches\n    matches = matcher(doc)\n\n    # Get the entities\n    entities = []\n    for match_id, start, end in matches:\n        span = doc[start:end]\n        entities.append((span.text, span.label_))\n\n    return entities\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(\"Brined Roast Turkey Breast with Confit Legs\")\n\n# Get the entities\nentities = custom_entity_recognition(doc)\n\n# Print the entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"('entity'<|>{entity[0].upper()}<|>{entity[1]}<|>{entity[0]}')\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify all pairs of related entities\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to perform relation extraction on the text.
