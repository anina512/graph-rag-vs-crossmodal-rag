Add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few pea-size pieces of butter remaining, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add 1/4 cup ice water and process until dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers; if it's very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not over-process.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together to form a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then roll into a ball. Flatten ball into a disc with smooth edges (no cracks), cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with several layers of paper towels. Arrange tomato slices on prepared sheet, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. salt, and cover with more paper towels. Let drain at least 30 minutes.\nPosition rack in bottom rung of oven and preheat to 350°F.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Entity Identification**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify entities in the text. We'll define a custom entity recognizer to identify organizations, people, and geographic locations.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define a custom entity recognizer\nmatcher = Matcher(nlp.vocab)\n\n# Define patterns for organizations, people, and geographic locations\npatterns = [\n    {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"ORG\", \"LOWER\": {\"REGEX\": r\"\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b\"}},\n    {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"PERSON\", \"LOWER\": {\"REGEX\": r\"\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b\"}},\n    {\"ENT_TYPE\": \"GPE\", \"LOWER\": {\"REGEX\": r\"\\b[A-Z][a-z]+\\b\"}},\n]\n\n# Add patterns to the matcher\nfor pattern in patterns:\n    matcher.add(\"ENT_TYPE\", [pattern])\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Find entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_))\n\n# Extract entity information\nentity_info = []\nfor ent in entities:\n    entity_name = ent[0].capitalize()\n    entity_type = ent[1]\n    entity_description = ent[0]\n    entity_info.append(f\"({entity_type}<{entity_name}<{entity_type}<{entity_description}>\")\n\n# Print entity information\nfor entity in entity_info:\n    print(entity)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Relationship Identification**\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify relationships between entities.
