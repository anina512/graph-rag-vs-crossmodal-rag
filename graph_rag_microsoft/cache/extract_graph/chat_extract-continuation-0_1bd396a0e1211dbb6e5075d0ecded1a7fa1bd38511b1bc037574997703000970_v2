Whisk egg, grated garlic, miso, milk, berbere, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Mix in Pecorino and panko. Add beef and currants and gently mix with your hands just until all ingredients are evenly incorporated (be careful not to overmix).\nWorking one at a time, scoop out 2 heaping Tbsp. (about 1 1/2 oz.) mixture and roll into balls between your palms. Place on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart (you should end up with about 15). Bake meatballs until lightly browned on top and cooked through, 20–25 minutes.\nMeanwhile, place kale in a large colander in the sink and pour 8 cups boiling water over top to wilt leaves. Run under cold water to rinse, then squeeze leaves thoroughly with your hands to remove excess liquid.\nHeat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add radishes and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden and crisp-tender, 5–7 minutes. Add kale and stir, breaking up leaves, until warmed through. Push kale and radishes to one side of skillet. Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil on the empty side and add sliced garlic. As soon as garlic starts to sizzle, stir it into vegetables. Remove pan from heat and add lemon juice to mixture; season with salt. Toss well.\nTear meatballs in half and add to skillet along with any pan juices. Toss everything together; divide among plates.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>OVEN-BAKED BEEF MEATBALLS<|>EVENT<|>Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs is a recipe for cooking meatballs in the oven)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG<|>PERSON<|>Egg is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>PERSON<|>Garlic is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHITE MISO<|>PERSON<|>White miso is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WHOLE MILK<|>PERSON<|>Whole milk is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>BERBERE<|>PERSON<|>Berbere is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARAM MASALA<|>PERSON<|>Garam masala is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KOSEHER SALT<|>PERSON<|>Kosher salt is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PECORINO<|>PERSON<|>Pecorino is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>PANKO<|>PERSON<|>Panko is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>GROUND BEEF<|>PERSON<|>Ground beef is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DRIED CURRANTS<|>PERSON<|>Dried currants are an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TUSCAN KALE<|>PERSON<|>Tuscan kale is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>PERSON<|>Olive oil is an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>RADISHES<|>PERSON<|>Radishes are an ingredient in Oven-Baked Beef Meatballs)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>PERSON<|>Lemon juice is an ingredient in"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
