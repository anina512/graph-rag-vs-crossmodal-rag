If there’s plenty of liquid in the pan from the mushrooms, rather than drain it, thicken it with a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in water or vegetable broth. To serve, ladle some of the mushroom mixture on top of individual servings of the pasta. Top with plenty of minced parsley and, for added plant power, some steamed fresh or frozen green peas.\nGive this dish some plant-based “beefiness” courtesy of seitan. Follow the recipe above, adding 8 to 16 ounces chopped seitan once the onion is translucent. Drizzle in a tablespoon or two of soy sauce. Cook over medium-high heat until the seitan is lightly browned, stirring often. Then proceed with the mushrooms, following the instructions for regular mushroom stroganoff above.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>EVENT<|>Mushrooms are a key ingredient in this recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PASTA<|>EVENT<|>Pasta is a key ingredient in this recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PARSLEY<|>EVENT<|>Parsley is a garnish for this dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN PEAS<|>EVENT<|>Green peas are a garnish for this dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SEITAN<|>EVENT<|>Seitan is a plant-based protein used to add \"beefiness\" to this dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SOY SAUCE<|>EVENT<|>Soy sauce is used to add flavor to this dish)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>EVENT<|>Onion is a key ingredient in this recipe)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>SEITAN<|>Mushrooms and seitan are both key ingredients in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PASTA<|>GREEN PEAS<|>Pasta and green peas are both key ingredients in this dish<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PASTA<|>SEITAN<|>Pasta and seitan are both key ingredients in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PASTA<|>SOY SAUCE<|>Pasta and soy sauce are both used in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>PASTA<|>ONION<|>Pasta and onion are both key ingredients in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN PEAS<|>SEITAN<|>Green peas and seitan are both used in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN PEAS<|>SOY SAUCE<|>Green peas and soy sauce are both used in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>GREEN PEAS<|>ONION<|>Green peas and onion are both key ingredients in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SEITAN<|>SOY SAUCE<|>Seitan and soy sauce are both used in this recipe<|>8)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SEITAN<|>ON"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
