Pour boiling water over to submerge, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit until chiles are very pliable and cool enough to handle, 15–20 minutes. Drain; remove stems and seeds and discard (wear gloves for this part if you have them).\nToast cumin and coriander in a dry small skillet over medium-low heat, tossing constantly, until very fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a food processor, add garlic, and pulse until spices are broken up and garlic forms a paste. Add chiles and pulse until chiles form a coarse paste. Add lemon juice, vinegar, tomato paste, paprika, and salt and process until mostly smooth but mixture still has a little texture. With the motor running, stream in ½ cup oil. Process until oil is incorporated.\nTransfer harissa to a bowl. Pour remaining ¼ cup oil over top.\nHarissa can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HOMEMADE 3-CHILE HARSSA<|>EVENT<|>Homemade 3-Chile Harissa is a recipe for a spicy condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILES DE ÁRBOL<|>GEO<|>Chiles de árbol are a type of dried pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUAJILLO CHILES<|>GEO<|>Guajillo chiles are a type of dried pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANCHO CHILE<|>GEO<|>Ancho chile is a type of dried pepper used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN SEEDS<|>GEO<|>Cumin seeds are a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CORIANDER SEEDS<|>GEO<|>Coriander seeds are a spice used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>GEO<|>Garlic is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMON JUICE<|>GEO<|>Lemon juice is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE WINE VINEGAR<|>GEO<|>White wine vinegar is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO PASTE<|>GEO<|>Tomato paste is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT SMOKED SPANISH PAPRIKA<|>GEO<|>Hot smoked Spanish paprika is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>GEO<|>Kosher salt is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>GEO<|>Olive oil is an ingredient used in the recipe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not in the text, but Durke Bataglani, Meggie Tazbah, and Samuel Namara are not in the text, but Durke Bataglani, Meggie Tazbah, and Samuel Namara are not in the text, but Durke Bataglani"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
