Put warm water, sugar, and oil in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes, until mixture foams. In a medium bowl, stir to combine flours, salt, and nasturtium flowers. Sprinkle flour mixture into yeast mixture. Mix on low speed for 5 minutes, until dough is smooth and bouncy. Cover the bowl with a cotton kitchen towel and let stand for about 1 hour, or until dough has doubled in volume.\n2. Turn dough onto a surface dusted with flour and knead by pushing it away from your body with the heel of your hand, folding it over, and repeating about 12 times. Divide dough into two balls. At this point, dough can be baked or stored for up to 2 days in the refrigerator on a baking sheet covered with plastic wrap.\n3. Preheat oven to 450°F. Rub two baking sheets with olive oil and dust with semolina flour. Stretch out each dough ball by tapping and pressing outward from the center with your fingertips. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Cover with toppings of your choice. Bake pizzas for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking so the dough browns evenly. Slice, serve, and enjoy.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>NASTURTIUM PIZZA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nasturtium Pizza is a recipe for a type of pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NASTURTIUM FLOWERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nasturtium flowers are used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERB FLOWER PESTO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Herb flower pesto is a topping used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOAT CHEESE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Goat cheese is a topping used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YEAST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yeast is a key ingredient in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Olive oil is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMOLINA FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Semolina flour is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIGH-GLUTEN BREAD FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-gluten bread flour is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARM WATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Warm water is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread flour is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is used in the recipe for Nasturtium Pizza)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>There is no information about Durke Bataglani in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>There is no information about Meggie Tazbah in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
