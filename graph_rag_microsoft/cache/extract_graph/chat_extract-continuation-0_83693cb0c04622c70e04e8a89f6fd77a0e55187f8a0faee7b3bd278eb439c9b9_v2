Transfer 2 Tbsp. dressing to a small bowl; set aside for serving.\nWorking in 2 batches, place green beans in a large resealable plastic or silicone bag. Seal bag and whack beans with a rolling pin to split the skins, break beans into smaller pieces, and soften the insides without completely pulverizing them. Transfer beans to large bowl with dressing. Add onion and toss, massaging with your hands to break beans down further and coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour or chill overnight.\nUsing your hands, lift beans out of bowl and transfer to a platter, leaving excess liquid behind. Whisk oil and reserved 2 Tbsp. dressing to combine, then drizzle over beans. Gently mix in peanuts.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Entity Identification\n\nWe'll use the spaCy library to identify entities in the text. We'll define a function to extract entities of the specified types.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\n\n# Load the English language model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef extract_entities(text, entity_types):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    entities = []\n    for ent in doc.ents:\n        if ent.label_ in entity_types:\n            entity_name = ent.text.capitalize()\n            entity_type = ent.label_\n            entity_description = ent.text\n            entities.append((\"entity\", entity_name, entity_type, entity_description))\n    return entities\n```\n\n### Step 2: Relationship Identification\n\nWe'll define a function to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a simple approach based on keyword matching.\n\n```python\ndef extract_relationships(entities):\n    relationships = []\n    for i in range(len(entities)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):\n            source_entity = entities[i][1]\n            target_entity = entities[j][1]\n            relationship_description = \"\"\n            for token in nlp(entities[i][3]):\n                if token.text in nlp(entities[j][3]).text:\n                    relationship_description += token.text + \" \"\n            relationship_strength = 1\n            relationships.append((\"relationship\", source_entity, target_entity, relationship_description, relationship_strength))\n    return relationships\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Entities and Relationships\n\nWe'll define a function to combine entities and relationships into a single list.\n\n```python\ndef combine_entities_and_relationships(entities, relationships):\n    combined_list = entities + relationships\n    return combined_list\n```\n\n### Step 4: Format Output\n\nWe'll define a function to format the output as required.\n\n```python\ndef format_output(combined_list):\n    output = \"\"\n    for item in combined_list:\n        if item[0] == \"entity\":\n            output += f\"({item[0]}<|>{item[1]}<|>{item[2]}<|>{item[3]})##\\n\"\n        elif item[0] == \"relationship\":\n            output += f\"({item[0]}<|>{item[1]}<"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
