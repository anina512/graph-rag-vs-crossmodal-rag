Serve the fries in decorative cones made out of any decorative paper or even something simple like a newspaper (why not the yellow pages?). Roll the paper into proportionate cones, line them with wax paper, and staple them at the edge. Serve the cones on a tray with the dipping sauces. Make the perfect tray yourself by punching holes in a box lid and placing the cones in the holes.\nBuy frozen French fries from your grocery store that just need to be heated or even ready-made ones from a restaurant. Get rid of the \"evidence\" and serve the fries in decorative cones with your homemade sauces.\nChop fresh herbs and mix with the pommes when they come out of the oven. It looks, smells, and tastes great. You can also use different colored potatoes, such as red skinned, orange sweet potatoes, or blue potatoes of the delta blue variety.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>KETCHUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ketchup is a type of condiment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Curry is a type of spice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIDGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fridge is a type of appliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARTY<|>EVENT<|>Party is a social gathering)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIVIDUAL SERVING CUPS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Individual serving cups are a type of tableware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Fries are a type of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DECORATIVE CONES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Decorative cones are a type of tableware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEWSPAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Newspaper is a type of publication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YELLOW PAGES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yellow pages are a type of directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAX PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wax paper is a type of wrapping material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOX LID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Box lid is a type of container)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRAY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tray is a type of tableware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROZEN FRENCH FRIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Frozen French fries are a type of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESTAURANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Restaurant is a type of establishment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROCERY STORE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Grocery store is a type of establishment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POMMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pommes are a type of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HERBS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Herbs are a type of plant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE SWEET POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Orange sweet potatoes are a type of food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUE POTATOES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blue"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
