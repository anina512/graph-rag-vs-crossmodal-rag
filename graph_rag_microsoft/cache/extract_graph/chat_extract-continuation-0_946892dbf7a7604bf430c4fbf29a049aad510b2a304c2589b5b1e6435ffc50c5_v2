Sprinkle spice mixture over roast. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.\nPreheat oven to 375°F. Heat oil in large wide ovenproof skillet over mediumhigh heat until nearly smoking. Add roast, fat side down, to skillet; cook until well browned on bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn roast, fat side up, and transfer skillet to oven.
