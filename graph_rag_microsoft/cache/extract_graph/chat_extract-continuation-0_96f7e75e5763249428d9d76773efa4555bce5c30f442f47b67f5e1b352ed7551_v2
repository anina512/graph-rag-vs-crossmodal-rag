Lightly season the ribs with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large sauté pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add the oil, then the ribs, and brown well on all sides. (To avoid overcrowding the pan, you may have to do this in batches.)\nWhile the ribs are searing, spray the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray. Add the ketchup, cola, tomato paste, garlic, brown sugar, chili sauce, bourbon, cider vinegar, sorghum syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, and cayenne. Stir well. Add the ribs to the slow cooker, layering the larger, fattier ribs on the bottom. Make sure all the ribs are covered in sauce. Cover and cook on low for at least 8 hours and up to 9 hours, until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender.\nTransfer the ribs to a platter and keep warm. Pour the leftover sauce into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until it is reduced and slightly thickened. Skim off any visible fat, season with salt and pepper, and serve the sauce over the ribs.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BOURBON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bourbon is a type of whiskey made in the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Coke is a brand of cola that is used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEINZ<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heinz is a brand of ketchup-based sauce that is used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KOSHER SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kosher salt is a type of salt used for seasoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Black pepper is a type of spice used for seasoning)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used for cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Garlic is a type of ingredient used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOMATO PASTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tomato paste is a type of ingredient used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BROWN SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Brown sugar is a type of sweetener used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILI SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chili sauce is a type of condiment used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIDER VINEGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cider vinegar is a type of vinegar used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SORGHUM SYRUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sorghum syrup is a type of sweetener used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Worcestershire sauce is a type of condiment used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHILI POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chili powder is a type of spice used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAYENNE PEPPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cayenne pepper is a type of spice used in the BBQ sauce)\n##\n(\""}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
