Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again, then beat in the buttermilk and vanilla.\nGradually add the flour mixture, beating just until smooth and well blended. Divide the dough in half. Flatten each half into a disc. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate until chilled and slightly stiff, at least 1 hour, but overnight ideally.\nPreheat the oven to 375°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\nOn a lightly floured surface, working with one portion at a time, roll the dough to a ¼-inch thickness. Cut with a floured 1½-inch round biscuit cutter. Gather the scraps, reroll, and cut again. Sprinkle lightly with demerara sugar. Transfer the tea cakes to the baking sheets and space them about 1 inch apart.\nBake until the tea cakes are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the pan for 1 minute, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. The tea cakes will keep for about 2 weeks in an airtight container.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>TEA CAKES<|>EVENT<|>Tea Cakes is a recipe for baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA CAKES<|>EVENT<|>Tea Cakes is a recipe for baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEA CAKES<|>EVENT<|>Tea Cakes is a recipe for baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>All-purpose flour is a type of flour used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING POWDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SODA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking soda is a leavening agent used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salt is a seasoning used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUTMEG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nutmeg is a spice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a fat used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sugar is a sweetener used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eggs are a common ingredient in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTERMILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Buttermilk is a liquid used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA EXTRACT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vanilla extract is a flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMERARA SUGAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Demerara sugar is a type of sugar used for sprinkling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stand mixer is a kitchen appliance used for mixing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PADDLE ATTACHMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paddle attachment is a part of a stand mixer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bowl is a kitchen container used for mixing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
