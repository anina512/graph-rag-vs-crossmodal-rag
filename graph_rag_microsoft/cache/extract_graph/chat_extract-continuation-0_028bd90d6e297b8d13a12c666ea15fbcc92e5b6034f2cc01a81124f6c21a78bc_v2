Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with orange frosting.\nButter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper cut to fit, and butter the parchment. Flour the pans, coating the bottom and sides of each pan, then tap out the excess flour. Divide the batter between the two pans and bake until the tops are dry to the touch, the sides of the cake start to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (for generally the same amount of time as in the cupcake recipe). Let cool on a wire rack, then remove each cake from its pan, discard the parchment paper, and set one cake layer on a cake round, frosting turntable, or the final serving platter. Frost the top of that cake layer with the frosting, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, gradually add the confectioners’ sugar, and beat until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium, add the milk, orange zest and juice, and vanilla and beat until fully blended, 1 to 2 minutes, making sure not to incorporate too much air into the frosting.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>CAKE<|>EVENT<|>Cake is a baked dessert that is typically round in shape and consists of two layers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Orange frosting is a type of frosting that is typically used to top cakes and consists of butter, confectioners' sugar, milk, orange zest, and orange juice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>GEO<|>Wire rack is a kitchen tool used to cool baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stand mixer is a kitchen appliance used to mix and beat ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAKE PANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cake pans are kitchen tools used to bake cakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOOTHPICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Toothpick is a kitchen tool used to test the doneness of baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parchment paper is a kitchen tool used to line cake pans)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>PERSON<|>Butter is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>PERSON<|>Salt is a type of seasoning used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR<|>PERSON<|>Confectioners' sugar is a type of sugar used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>PERSON<|>Milk is a type of dairy product used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE ZEST<|>PERSON<|>Orange zest is a type of citrus peel used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORANGE JUICE<|>PERSON<|>Orange juice is a type of citrus juice used in baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA<|>PERSON<|>Vanilla is a type of flavoring used in baking)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAKE<|>ORANGE FROSTING<|>Cake is typically topped with orange frosting<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>CAKE<|>Wire rack is used to cool cakes<|>8)\n##\n"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
