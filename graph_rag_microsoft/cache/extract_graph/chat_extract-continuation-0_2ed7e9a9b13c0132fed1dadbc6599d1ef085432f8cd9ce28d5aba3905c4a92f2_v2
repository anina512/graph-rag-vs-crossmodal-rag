Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for an additional 5 minutes by hand, or until it is soft and smooth. Divide the dough in half and then roll into 2 cylinders (about 1 inch in diameter). Cover the cylinders with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Alternatively, to make the dough by hand, place the flour in a large bowl and slowly stir in the boiling water. Then add the cold water and mix until well combined. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until the dough is soft and smooth. Divide the dough in half and then roll into 2 cylinders (about 1 inch in diameter). Cover the cylinders with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\nUse a sharp knife to cut each of the cylinders into 26 rounds, and cover the rounds with plastic wrap when not working with them so that they don't dry out. Roll each round into a ball. Then on a lightly floured work surface, flatten each ball into a 3-inch-wide disk, first with the palm of your hand and then using a mini rolling pin and working in a circular motion. The wrappers will keep in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>EVENT<|>Dumpling Wrappers is a recipe for making dumpling wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>EVENT<|>Dumpling Wrappers is a recipe for making dumpling wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGREDIENTS<|>EVENT<|>Ingredients for Dumpling Wrappers include all-purpose flour, boiling water, and cold water)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An electric mixer is used to mix the dough for Dumpling Wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORK BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The work bowl of the electric mixer is used to mix the dough for Dumpling Wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is used to cover the dough and the dumpling wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARP KNIFE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sharp knife is used to cut the dumpling wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINI ROLLING PIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A mini rolling pin is used to flatten the dumpling wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR<|>INGREDIENT<|>All-purpose flour is an ingredient in Dumpling Wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOILING WATER<|>INGREDIENT<|>Boiling water is an ingredient in Dumpling Wrappers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLD WATER<|>INGREDIENT<|>Cold water is an ingredient in Dumpling Wrappers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>ELECTRIC MIXER<|>Dumpling Wrappers are made using an electric mixer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>WORK BOWL<|>Dumpling Wrappers are made using the work bowl of the electric mixer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>Dumpling Wrappers are covered with plastic wrap<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMPLING WRAPPERS<|>SHARP KNIFE<|>Dumpling Wrappers are cut using a sharp knife"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
