Sprinkle date mixture over bread and toss to distribute evenly. Using electric mixer, beat eggs and egg yolks in large bowl until frothy. Add 1 cup sugar and beat until mixture thickens and is pale yellow, about 5 minutes. Add half and half, vanilla, and nutmeg; beat just until blended. (Bread mixture and custard can be prepared 2 hours ahead. Let bread mixture stand uncovered at room temperature. Chill custard; rewhisk before continuing.)\nPreheat oven to 375°F. Pour custard over bread mixture, then press lightly on bread with rubber spatula to submerge. Let stand 15 minutes, occasionally pressing lightly on bread to submerge.\nBake bread pudding 25 minutes.
