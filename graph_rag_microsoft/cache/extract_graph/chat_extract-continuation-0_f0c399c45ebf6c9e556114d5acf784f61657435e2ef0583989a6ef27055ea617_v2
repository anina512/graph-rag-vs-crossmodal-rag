Line cupcake tins with the liners. Fill the tins two-thirds full with the batter and bake the cupcakes as directed in the recipe .\n2. Frost the cupcakes, reserving some of the frosting. Pile the frosting up a little in the center to make a sort of domed shape, more like an eyeball. To make the surface smooth, dip a butter or frosting/palette knife in hot water and smooth it over the top of the frosting.\n3. Tint the remaining frosting bright red with the food coloring. Using the pastry bag, pipe the red frosting on the tops of the cupcake in vein patterns. Make the veins radiate from the center of the cupcake to make the bloodshot quality more realistic. Cut the jelly beans in half. Place a jelly bean half into the circle of the round candy. Now you have and iris and a pupil. Place this in the center of a cupcake. Continue with the rest of the eyeballs.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>EYEBALL CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Eyeball Cupcakes is a recipe for making eyeball-shaped cupcakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE PAPER CUPCAKE LINERS<|>EVENT<|>White paper cupcake liners are used to line the cupcake tins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RECIPE BATTER FOR CUPCAKES<|>EVENT<|>Recipe batter for cupcakes is used to fill the cupcake tins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VANILLA BUTTER CREAM FROSTING<|>EVENT<|>Vanilla butter cream frosting is used to frost the cupcakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED FOOD COLORING<|>EVENT<|>Red food coloring is used to tint the frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASTRY BAG AND SMALL ROUND TIP<|>EVENT<|>Pastry bag and small round tip are used to pipe the red frosting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL BLACK JELLY BEANS<|>EVENT<|>Small black jelly beans are used to make the pupil of the eyeball)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROUND CANDIES WITH HOLE IN THE MIDDLE<|>EVENT<|>Round candies with hole in the middle are used to make the iris of the eyeball)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WHITE PAPER CUPCAKE LINERS<|>RECIPE BATTER FOR CUPCAKES<|>White paper cupcake liners are used to line the cupcake tins for the recipe batter for cupcakes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RECIPE BATTER FOR CUPCAKES<|>VANILLA BUTTER CREAM FROSTING<|>Recipe batter for cupcakes is used to fill the cupcake tins and then frosted with vanilla butter cream frosting<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BUTTER CREAM FROSTING<|>RED FOOD COLORING<|>Vanilla butter cream frosting is tinted with red food coloring<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VANILLA BUTTER CREAM FROSTING<|>PASTRY BAG AND SMALL ROUND TIP<|>Vanilla butter cream frosting is piped with a pastry bag and small round tip<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
