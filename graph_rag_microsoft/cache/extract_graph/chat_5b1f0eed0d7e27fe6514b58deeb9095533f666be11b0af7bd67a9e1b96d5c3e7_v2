Place the container in which you refrigerated the custard in the freezer, so you can use it to store ice cream. Churn the ice cream until the texture resembles “soft serve.”While the ice cream churns, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F; position the rack in the middle. Spread the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven for about 5 minutes or until fragrant; transfer the nuts to a bowl to cool. In the last minute of churning, add the toasted walnuts and churn until incorporated. Transfer the ice cream back to its chilled storage container and freeze until hardened to your desired consistency. Alternatively, you can serve it immediately — it will be the consistency of gelato. The ice cream will keep, frozen, for up to 7 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5b1f0eed0d7e27fe6514b58deeb9095533f666be11b0af7bd67a9e1b96d5c3e7_v2"}
