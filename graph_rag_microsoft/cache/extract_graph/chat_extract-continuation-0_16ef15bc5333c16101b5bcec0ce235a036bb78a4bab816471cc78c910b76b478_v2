Some of my favorites include Fromage d’Affinois, Saint-Marcellin, Bûcheron, mascarpone, and even Saint Agur (a particularly creamy blue). Their flavor will shine through clearly, so choose something you know and love.\nGreen Tea Cheesecake: The herbal, mossy flavor of Japanese green tea provides a lovely counterpoint to the tangy richness of cream cheese. Simply whisk 2 tablespoons matcha (not bagged or loose green tea) into the sugar and proceed as directed.\nPumpkin Cheesecake: Reduce cream cheese to 1 1/2 pounds (3 cups), replace lemon juice with ½ ounce (1 tablespoon) dark rum, and increase kosher salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Along with sugar, add 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 1½ teaspoons ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Omit heavy cream, and replace with 15 ounces (1 2/3 cups) pumpkin puree. If you like, serve with butterscotch sauce and a sprinkling of toasted hazelnut pieces.\nGluten-Free: Prepare crust with the Gluten-Free variation of my Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers (TK LINK TO RECIPE); thanks to the roasted soybean flour in the dough, they bake up with a nutty richness much like classic whole wheat.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>COOKIE CRUMB CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>Cookie Crumb Cheesecake is a type of cheesecake that uses cookie crumbs instead of traditional graham cracker crumbs)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FROMAGE<|>EVENT<|>Fromage is a type of cheesecake that uses a variety of soft, rich cheeses)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GREEN TEA CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>Green Tea Cheesecake is a type of cheesecake that incorporates Japanese green tea for a unique flavor)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE<|>EVENT<|>Pumpkin Cheesecake is a type of cheesecake that incorporates pumpkin puree and spices for a seasonal flavor)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GLUTEN-FREE<|>EVENT<|>Gluten-Free is a variation of the Crispy Whole Wheat Graham Crackers recipe that uses roasted soybean flour)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COOKIE CRUMBS<|>EVENT<|>Cookie crumbs are a key ingredient in the Cookie Crumb Cheesecake recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>OREO CRUMBS<|>EVENT<|>Oreo crumbs are a type of cookie crumb that can be used in place of traditional graham cracker crumbs)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NUTTER BUTTER CRUMBS<|>EVENT<|>Nutter Butter crumbs are a type of cookie crumb that can be used in place of traditional graham cracker crumbs)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FROMAGE D'AFFINOS<|>EVENT<|>Fromage d'Affinois is a type of cheese that can be used in the Fromage cheesecake recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAINT-MARCELLIN<|>EVENT<|>Saint-Marcellin is a type of cheese that can be used in the Fromage cheesecake recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>BÛCHERON<|>EVENT<|>Bûcheron is a type of cheese that can be used in the Fromage cheesecake recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MASCARPONE<|>EVENT<|>Mascarpone is a type of cheese that can be used in the Fromage cheesecake recipe)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAINT AGUR<|>EVENT<|>Saint Agur is a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
