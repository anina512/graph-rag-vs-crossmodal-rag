Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes.\nDrain the potatoes, reserving the syrup, and let cool. Once the potatoes are at room temperature, put them back in the cooled syrup to store in the refrigerator until ready to use. Drain the potatoes well before using. You should have about 2 cups.\nIn a nonreactive bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients until well combined. Add the corvina and toss to combine. Add the celery, red onion, and chopped cilantro and mix well.\nTransfer the ceviche to individual glasses or a large shallow bowl. Place about 1 cup of the candied sweet potatoes on the sides of the glasses or bowl and top with the cilantro leaves.
