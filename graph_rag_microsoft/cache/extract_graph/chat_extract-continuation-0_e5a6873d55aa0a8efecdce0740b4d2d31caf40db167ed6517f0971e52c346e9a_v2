Divide each piece into 3 pieces, each weighing about 1.3 ounces (36 grams). Keep remaining dough covered while working with each batch.\nUsing lightly floured hands, roll 1 dough piece between palms to form smooth, 1 3/4-inch-wide ball. Pinch indentation on bottom of ball tightly to seal. Repeat to form remaining balls.\nTransfer melted butter to small bowl. Dip each dough ball into melted butter, coating all sides, and transfer, sealed-side-down, to prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Lightly coat sheet of plastic wrap with vegetable oil or nonstick vegetable-oil spray and gently cover pan with oiled wrap. Let rolls rise in warm place until doubled in size and depression very slowly fills in when pressed with fingertip, about 45 minutes.\nWhile dough is rising, position rack near bottom of oven and top with baking stone or heavy baking sheet. Set aluminum foil-lined cast-iron pan or heavy rimmed baking pan on floor of oven and preheat oven to 400ºF for 1 hour.\nQuickly transfer baking sheet with rolls to hot baking stone (see Chef's Notes) and add 1/2 cup ice cubes to pan beneath.\nBake rolls, rotating pan 180 degrees halfway through, until golden brown and skewer inserted in middles comes out clean (instant read thermometer inserted into center will register about 190ºF), about 12 minutes. Transfer rolls from baking sheet to rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n•Dough rises best around 75°F to 80°F. If your house is on the cold side, you can set a container of very hot tap water near the rising dough and cover the dough and the hot water with a large plastic container or bowl—you will need to reheat the water every 30 to 40 minutes. Alternatively you can place the dough (and the small container of very hot water) in a microwave oven (not turned on) or a standard oven without a pilot light, but with the oven light turned on to provide gentle heat. •If you want to make this bread over a 2-day period, you can refrigerate it overnight after the first rise. Once it has doubled in size (first rise), gently press the dough down in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap that has been lightly coated with vegetable oil or nonstick vegetable-oil spray\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough is a mixture of ingredients used to make bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking sheet is a flat surface used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Plastic wrap is a type of wrapping material used to cover food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VEGETABLE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vegetable oil is a type of oil used for cooking and baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Butter is a type of fat used for baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALUMINUM FOIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Aluminum foil is a type of wrapping material used for cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron pan is a type of cooking vessel made from cast iron)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heavy baking sheet is a type of baking sheet made from heavy material)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING STONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baking stone is a type of cooking surface used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance used for baking and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROWAVE OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microwave oven is a type of cooking appliance used for reheating and cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHEF'S NOTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chef's notes are additional information provided by the chef)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant read thermometer is a type of thermometer used to measure temperature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPERATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Temperature is a measure of heat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOOD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Food is a type of substance used for nutrition and sustenance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAKING<|>EVENT<|>Baking is the process of cooking food in an oven"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
