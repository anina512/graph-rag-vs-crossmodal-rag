Identify all entities.

(Don’t bother scooping out the seeds.) Rub the squash halves all over with olive oil and place each piece on a baking sheet, cut-side down. Roast for 25 minutes, then flip the squash and continue cooking until tender all over, another 10 to 30 minutes—you should be able to pierce the neck of the squash with a paring knife and meet very little resistance. Allow to cool, then scoop out the seeds and discard them. Use a spoon to scoop all of the flesh into a bowl and discard the skins. Coarsely mash the squash with a spoon or fork and season with salt. Packed in an airtight container, it will keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Step 1: Identify all entities\nWe will use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text.
