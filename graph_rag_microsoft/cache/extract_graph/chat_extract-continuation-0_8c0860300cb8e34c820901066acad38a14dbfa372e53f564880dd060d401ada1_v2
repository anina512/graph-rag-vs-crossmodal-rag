Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data, including the ability to extract information such as entity recognition.\n\n2. **Entity Type Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to extract relationships.\n\n4. **Relationship Strength Scoring**: Use a machine learning model to score the strength of each relationship.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nfrom spacy.matcher import Matcher\nfrom spacy.tokens import Span\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the text\ntext = \"\"\"\nChicken Barbecue (Inihaw na Manok)\n\nIngredients:\n['2 1/4 cups (540 ml) banana ketchup', '1 cup (240 ml) 7UP', '1/2 cup (120 ml) fresh lemon juice', '1/2 cup (120 ml) soy sauce', '1/2 cup (120 ml) white sugarcane vinegar', '1/2 cup (110 g) packed brown sugar', '1/4 cup (35 g) minced garlic', '3 pounds (1.4 kg) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces', 'Cooking spray or vegetable oil, for greasing', 'Sawsawan, for serving']\n\nInstructions:\nIn a large nonreactive bowl, storage container, or Ziploc bag, mix together the banana ketchup, 7UP, lemon juice, soy"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
