Let the braising liquid cool slightly, then strain the liquid into a bowl (discard the solids).\nSkim off any fat that has risen to the top.\nPurée the braising liquid in a blender.\nTo make the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to combine with the oil. Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cider and the tomato paste and mix well.\nReturn the braising liquid to the pot along with the remaining 1 1/2 cups beef broth and the remaining 2 thyme sprigs. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the sauce is thickened.\nSeason the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the thyme sprigs.\nTo serve, slice the pot roast, arrange the vegetables around it, and pour the sauce over the top.\nIn many pot roast recipes, there is an element of alcohol. In mine, I use hard cider, but you can also try red wine, a heavy beer, or—for your Irish friends—Guinness. The booze gives the meat an extra dimension but won’t get the family hammered.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Step 1: Identify all entities\nTo identify all entities, we need to extract the relevant information from the text.
