Prepare the salmon fillets by trimming the extra thin belly part. Use tweezers to pull out any bones. Blot dry and sprinkle half of the cinnamon on the meat side of each fillet and set aside to make the filling.\nIn a food processor, place the walnuts, garlic, cilantro, parsley, lemon juice and zest, chilies, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, olive oil, salt and pepper. Pulse a couple of times until all the ingredients are chopped. Don't overprocess—try to keep a slightly coarse texture.\nPlace one fillet skin side down on a working surface and place enough of the spicy walnut filling to fully coat the fish. Cover with the other fillet skin side up. Using the kitchen twine, gently tie up the fish to ensure the filling stays in place. Drizzle olive oil in the baking dish and put in the prepared fillet, drizzling a little more oil on top. Season with salt and pepper. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until done. Serve with tabbouleh and spicy tahini sauce on the side to drizzle over the cooked fish.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WALNUT AND HERB-STUFFED SALMON<|>EVENT<|>Walnut and Herb-Stuffed Salmon is a dish made with salmon fillets and a mixture of walnuts, herbs, and spices)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TECHGLOBAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TechGlobal is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>VISION HOLDINGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Vision Holdings is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>FIRUZABAD<|>GEO<|>Firuzabad is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>AURELIA<|>GEO<|>Aurelia is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>QUINTARA<|>GEO<|>Quintara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TIRUZIA<|>GEO<|>Tiruzia is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>KROHAARA<|>GEO<|>Krohaara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>CASHION<|>GEO<|>Cashion is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL NAMARA<|>PERSON<|>Samuel Namara is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>ALHAMIA PRISON<|>GEO<|>Alhamia Prison is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>DURKE BATAGLANI<|>PERSON<|>Durke Bataglani is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>MEGGIE TAZBAH<|>PERSON<|>Meggie Tazbah is not mentioned in the text)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>WALNUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walnut is a type of tree and not an organization)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>HERB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Herb is a type of plant and not an organization)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>SALMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Salmon is a type of fish and not an organization)\n##\n## (\"entity\"<|>TECHGLOBAL"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
