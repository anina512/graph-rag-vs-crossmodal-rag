Sift through a medium-mesh strainer into a small bowl; stir to combine. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 month ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\nPat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub inside and out with salt; transfer to roasting bag. Stuff turkey with cardamom pods and cumin seeds, then onion, celery, and garlic.\nPurée all ingredients in a blender. Pour marinade into roasting bag. Smear all over turkey. Tie bag and arrange turkey, breast side down, in a large heavy roasting pan. Refrigerate overnight.\nLet turkey stand in bag at room temperature for 1 hour. Turn breast side up. Create steam holes in bag if required by manufacturer's instructions.\nPreheat oven to 400°F. Roast turkey for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh (puncturing bag with thermometer) registers 160°, about 1 1/2 hours longer. Cut top of bag open, being careful of steam and juices, and pull back over turkey. Roast turkey until breast is deeply browned but not burned and a thermometer inserted into thigh registers 165°F, 15-30 minutes longer.\nTransfer to a platter. Let rest for at least 20 minutes before carving.\nMeanwhile, strain juices into a large saucepan. Spoon fat from surface. Simmer over medium heat until sauce is reduced to 3 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes.\nCarve turkey. Serve with accompanying gravy.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SPICE MILL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device used to grind spices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEDIUM-MESH STRAINER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A kitchen tool used to sift through a mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL BOWL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A container used to hold a mixture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURKEY<|>PERSON<|>A type of bird often served as food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A seasoning used to add flavor to food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTING BAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bag used to cook a turkey in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARDAMOM PODS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of spice used to add flavor to food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUMIN SEEDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of spice used to add flavor to food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ONION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELERY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of vegetable used in cooking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device used to purée ingredients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROASTING PAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pan used to cook a turkey in the oven)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device used to measure the internal temperature of a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A device used to cook a turkey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dish used to serve food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAUCEPAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A pan used to simmer juices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAVY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A sauce served with food)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPICE MILL<|>MEDIUM-MESH STRAINER<|>The spice mill is used to grind spices, which are then sifted through a"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
