Cut a round of parchment paper so it’s slightly larger than dough; place over top. Remove pot from oven and set on stovetop.\nWorking on stove next to Dutch oven, invert dough onto a plate (parchment side will be down). Use a lame or a razor blade taped to an ice-pop stick to slash dough in desired pattern, using swift and deliberate strokes to cut at least 1/2\" deep into dough. Working quickly and wearing mitts on both hands, slide dough and parchment into center of pot. Cover pot and bake bread 15 minutes. Remove lid and ­continue to bake, rotating pot halfway through, until crust is very well done—approaching the edge of burnt—30–40 minutes. Carefully ­transfer bread to a wire rack. When it’s cool enough to handle, remove parchment.\nResist the temptation to cut into that just-out-of-the-oven loaf. Trust us. You want to wait at least a couple of hours so the starches in the bread have time to set. This gives the bread a better texture. If you’re dead set on eating it warm, reheat part of the loaf in a 300°F oven (which will also revive the crust), then slice.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>DUTCH OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dutch oven is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE-POP STICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ice-pop stick is a type of stick used for applying toppings to ice pops)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lame is a type of tool used for cutting dough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of rack used for cooling baked goods)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Stove is a type of cooking appliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oven is a type of cooking appliance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARCHMENT PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Parchment paper is a type of paper used for lining baking sheets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RICE FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rice flour is a type of flour used for baking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOUGH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dough is a type of mixture used for baking bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person who is working on the stove)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STARCHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Starches are a type of compound found in bread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Bread is a type of baked good)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT<|>EVENT<|>Baking bread is an event)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>DUTCH OVEN<|>Samuel is working on the stove next to the Dutch oven<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>ICE-POP STICK<|>Samuel is using the ice-pop stick to apply toppings to the bread<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>LAME<|>Samuel is using the lame to cut the dough<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAMUEL<|>WIRE RACK<|>Samuel is using the wire rack to cool the bread"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
