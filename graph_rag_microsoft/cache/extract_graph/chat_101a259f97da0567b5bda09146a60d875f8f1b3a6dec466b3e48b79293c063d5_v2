Add yogurt and vanilla; beat until well combined. Coat 3 baking sheets with cooking spray. Heat oven to 400°F. Whisk flour, cocoa powder and baking soda in a second bowl. Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on high in a third bowl until combined; add egg white and beat until mixture is thick and pale yellow. Add half the flour mixture to sugar and butter mixture; beat until just combined. Add 1/4 cup milk; beat on low speed until combined. Repeat with remaining flour mixture and remaining 1/4 cup milk. Spoon batter into a large resealable bag; squeeze batter into a corner of the bag and clip 1/4 inch off corner to make a piping bag. Squeeze 16 lines of batter, 4 inches long and 1 inch apart, onto each baking sheet. Bake until centers spring back to the touch, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Spread half the cakes with cream cheese filling; top with a second cake to make sandwiches and dust with cocoa powder, if desired. Serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_101a259f97da0567b5bda09146a60d875f8f1b3a6dec466b3e48b79293c063d5_v2"}
