Add the thyme, garlic and Marsala to the pan and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until the onions are golden and caramelized all over. Remove the onions from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels to drain away the excess oil and butter. Leave to cool completely.\nNext, make the pancakes. Whisk the eggs with the flour in a large mixing bowl, then slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time until no lumps are visible. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface of the batter.\nWarm a 26 cm. (10 in.) non-stick frying pan with a splash of sunflower oil over a medium-high heat. Pour half a ladle of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to evenly coat the base.\nCook each pancake for a minute on each side, until lightly golden, then flip and cook the other side. The mixture should produce 6-8 thin pancakes.\nCook the spinach for a minute with a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg in a frying pan until bright green and just wilted. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can through a sieve, then dry on kitchen paper.\nLay out a 30cm (12 in.) piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface, then lay 4 cooled pancakes alongside each other on the plastic wrap (you can use any extra when making the Wellington), ensuring a generous amount of overlap so that there is a continuous length down the middle of the plastic wrap. Brush the pancake all over with some of the egg yolk, then arrange the spinach down the middle of the pancakes, leaving a couple of centimeters at each end without spinach.\nPlace the mushrooms on top of the spinach, placing one on top of the other, giving four layers of two down the center. Top the mushrooms with the caramelized onion mixture, then use the plastic wrap to lift the pancake over the filling on either side. Fold over the ends and continue rolling until you have a tight cylinder shape. If there are any gaps, use the extra pancakes to patch up, brushing with egg yolk as you go. Wrap the pancake tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nRoll out the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SALT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>COOK<|>PERSON<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>THYME<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MARSALA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ONIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FLOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MILK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>ROSEMARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SUNFLOWER OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>SPINACH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>NUTMEG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>PLASTIC WRAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN PAPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>MUSHROOMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>WELLINGTON<|>EVENT<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>FRIDGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>CARMALIZED ONION MIXTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"entity\"<|>EGG YOLK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>No description available)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>SALT<|>COOK<|>No description available<|>0)\n## (\"relationship\"<|>COOK<|>THYME<|>No"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
