Toast sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Immediately transfer to a large bowl.\nMeanwhile, finely grate zest from lemon into a medium bowl; set aside. Place peaches in a 13x9\" baking dish. Halve lemon and squeeze 1 Tbsp. juice over peaches, then sprinkle ⅓ cup sugar and ¾ tsp. salt over. Toss to gently combine, then let sit while you prep the topping, at least 20 minutes.\nAdd flour and remaining 1¼ cups sugar and 1 tsp. salt to bowl with sesame seeds. Whisk to combine.\nAdd butter and cinnamon to bowl with lemon zest. Microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. (Or, if you don't have a microwave, melt butter with cinnamon and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium.) Whisk in tahini and oil.\nScrape tahini mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated (mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand).\nThe peaches should look juicy at this point. Add 1 tsp. cornstarch. If they’re really juicy, add another 1 tsp. Gently toss to combine. (If your peaches happen to be not-so-ripe and aren't juicy, don't add any cornstarch.)\nSqueeze topping into big clumps, then break off uneven pieces and scatter over peaches.\nBake crumble until topping is well browned and firm, peaches are tender, and juices are bubbling, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly.\nDivide crumble among shallow bowls and add a scoop of ice cream if desired.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
