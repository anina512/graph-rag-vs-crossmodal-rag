Cover any exposed cake on sides with more buttercream but leave cut ends exposed.\nUse spatula to create textured lines in buttercream to look like birch bark.\nKnead together marzipan and cocoa powder on a surface until smooth. Roll out on a sheet of parchment paper to less than 1/8\" thick, then cut out wavy strips to look like tree knots; drape over buttercream and press gently to adhere.\nUsing either a pastry bag fitted with a very small round tip or a disposable plastic bag with one corner snipped off, drizzle melted chocolate over log to mimic birch bark striations. Chill Bûche de Noël, uncovered, until ready to serve.\nJust before serving, press mushrooms perpendicularly into log in groups of 2 or 3.\nBûche de Noël (without meringue mushrooms) can be assembled 1 day ahead. Wrap in plastic and chill.
