Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: Use a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify entities in the text. We'll use the spaCy library, which provides high-performance, streamlined processing of text data.\n2. **Entity Classification**: Use a machine learning model to classify the identified entities into the specified types (organization, person, geo, event).\n3. **Relationship Extraction**: Use a relationship extraction model to identify relationships between entities. We'll use a rule-based approach to extract relationships based on the context in which entities are mentioned.\n4. **Relationship Scoring**: Assign a score to each relationship based on the strength of the relationship. We'll use a simple scoring system, where relationships with more context and co-occurrence are assigned higher scores.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\nimport re\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Load the spaCy model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Define the entity types\nentity_types = [\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"GEO\", \"EVENT\"]\n\n# Define the relationship extraction rules\nrelationship_rules = [\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"PERSON\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"PERSON\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"employee\"),\n    (\"GEO\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"headquarters\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"GEO\", \"headquarters\"),\n    (\"EVENT\", \"ORGANIZATION\", \"host\"),\n    (\"ORGANIZATION\", \"EVENT\", \"host\"),\n]\n\n# Process the text\ntext = \"Porchetta-Style Roast Pork\"\n\n# Tokenize the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Identify entities\nentities = []\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    entity = {\n        \"name\": ent.text,\n        \"type\": ent.label_,\n        \"description\": ent.text,\n    }\n    entities.append(entity)\n\n# Classify entities\nfor entity in entities:\n    if entity[\"type\"] == \"ORGANIZATION\":\n        entity[\"description\"] = \"Organization\"\n    elif entity[\"type\"] == \"PERSON\":\n        entity[\"description\"] = \"Person\"\n    elif entity[\"type\"] == \"GEO\":\n        entity[\"description\"] = \"Geographic location\"\n    elif entity[\"type\"] == \"EVENT\":\n        entity[\"description\"] = \"Event\"\n\n# Extract", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "provider_specific_fields": {"stop_reason": null}}], "created": 1763454655, "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 2190, "total_tokens": 2702, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n \n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

Transfer seeds to spice mill and cool. Add kosher salt, peppercorns, and dried crushed red pepper. Grind to medium-fine consistency (not powder).\nPlace pork in 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Rub garlic all over pork, then coat with spice mixture. Loosely cover pork with waxed paper. Refrigerate overnight.\nPreheat oven to 450°F. Brush large rimmed baking sheet with oil. Place roast, fat side up and coating intact, in center of sheet. Drizzle evenly with 2 tablespoons oil. Roast pork 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Roast pork until very tender and thermometer inserted into center of pork registers 190°F, about 3 hours 15 minutes longer. Transfer pork to cutting board; reserve baking sheet. Let pork rest 15 to 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, pour all pan juices into 2-cup measuring cup. Spoon off fat that rises to top. Place reserved baking sheet across 2 burners. Pour wine and broth onto baking sheet and bring to boil over medium-high heat, scraping up any browned bits. Boil until wine mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, about 4 minutes. Add degreased pan juices and whisk to blend. Pour pan sauce into small bowl (sauce will be thin).\nThinly slice roast. Serve with sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_29790b14498e90cc7cb64eff8671fa21ea0e97b705c93badb5a3bb3f50f6793a_v2"}
