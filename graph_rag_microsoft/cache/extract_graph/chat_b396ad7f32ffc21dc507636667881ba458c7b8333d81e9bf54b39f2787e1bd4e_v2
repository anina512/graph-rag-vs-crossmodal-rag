Place the slabs on a clean chopping board. Using your fingers, pull off the thick white membrane. Use a small knife to trim off the excess fat and meat. Using a sharp knife, trim off the brisket bone. Season both sides of the slab with salt and Neely's Barbecue Seasoning, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to a day in advance.\nWhen you're ready to cook the ribs, preheat the grill to 250°F, preferably using a combination of hickory wood and charcoal. Place the slab on the grill away from (not directly over) the flame (using indirect heat). Cook the slab curl-side up for approximately 2 1/2 hours. Flip the slab over to finish the cooking, about 1 more hour, or until you get the full \"bend\" in the slab (see Tony's Tip).\nFor dry ribs, pull the ribs off the grill, and sprinkle more Neely's Barbecue Seasoning over the entire slab. Cut between the bones and serve. For wet ribs, pull the ribs off the grill, and pour Neely's Barbecue Sauce over the slab. Slice between the bones into individual portions, and serve.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b396ad7f32ffc21dc507636667881ba458c7b8333d81e9bf54b39f2787e1bd4e_v2"}
