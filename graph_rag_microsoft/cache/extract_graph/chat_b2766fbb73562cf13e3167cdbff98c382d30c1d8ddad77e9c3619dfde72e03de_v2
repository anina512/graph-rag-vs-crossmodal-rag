Transfer yogurt to lined sieve, then pull up and tie together edges of cheesecloth, wrapping yogurt into bundle. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to drain in refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight. (The yogurt can be prepared 2 days ahead. Once drained, transfer to airtight container and refrigerate, covered.)\nIn medium heavy saucepan, combine milk and sea salt with 3/4 cup water. Bring to boil over high heat, then gradually whisk in polenta, until smooth. Reduce heat to low and cook, uncovered, whisking often, until very thick, about 25 minutes. Spread into 8- x 8-inch baking dish and cool slightly. Cover and chill until firm, at least 6 hours or overnight. (Polenta can be prepared ahead and refrigerated, covered, up to 1 day.)\nBring small pan of water to boil. Add pistachios and boil, uncovered, 1 minute. Drain, then roll between towels until brown papery skins are removed. Set pistachios aside.\nIf using charcoal grill, open vents on bottom, then light charcoal and preheat grill to moderately high. If using gas grill, preheat burners on high with hood closed 10 minutes, then turn down to moderately high. Brush grill rack with oil.\nCut polenta into 4 rectangles and grill, turning once, until heated through and crusty, about 3 minutes per side.
