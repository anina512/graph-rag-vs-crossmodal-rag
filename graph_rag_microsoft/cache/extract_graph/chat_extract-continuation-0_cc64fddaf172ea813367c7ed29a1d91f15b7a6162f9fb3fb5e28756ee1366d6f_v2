Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt). Place on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and let sit at room temperature while you make the garlic butter, or chill, uncovered, up to 1 day. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 1 hour before roasting.\nPlace a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°F. Coarsely chop 4 green garlic stalks; transfer to a food processor. Pulse until very finely chopped. Add zest and butter and pulse until almost smooth. Cut remaining 4 green garlic stalks in half lengthwise; set aside.\nPat chicken dry again with paper towels (this will help the butter adhere and get the skin nicely browned). Smear garlic butter all over chicken. Gently lift the skin on the breast away from the flesh and rub some butter inside.\nToss reserved green garlic and oil in a large cast-iron skillet or 13x9\" baking dish to coat; season with salt. Tie chicken legs together with kitchen twine and tuck wings underneath back. Place chicken, breast side up, on top of garlic in skillet.\nRoast chicken, rotating pan halfway through for even browning, until skin is golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F (don’t worry; temperature will climb to 165°F as the chicken rests), 80–90 minutes. Let chicken rest at least 20 minutes and up to 45 minutes.\nTransfer chicken to a cutting board and carve as desired. Serve with roasted green garlic alongside.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN-GARLIC-RUBBED BUTTERY ROAST CHICKEN<|>EVENT<|>Green-Garlic-Rubbed Buttery Roast Chicken is a recipe for cooking a whole chicken)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WHOLE CHICKEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Whole chicken is a type of food product)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>DIAMOND CRYSTAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Diamond Crystal is a brand of kosher salt)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>MORTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Morton is a brand of kosher salt)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>LEMON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lemon is a type of citrus fruit)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>GREEN GARLIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Green garlic is a type of garlic)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>UNSALTED BUTTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unsalted butter is a type of dairy product)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Extra-virgin olive oil is a type of oil)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>KITCHEN TWINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kitchen twine is a type of string)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CAST-IRON SKILLET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cast-iron skillet is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>13X9 BAKING DISH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>13x9 baking dish is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>WIRE RACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Wire rack is a type of cooking tool)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>RIMMED BAKING SHEET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rimmed baking sheet is a type of cooking vessel)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>PAPER TOWELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paper towels are a type of cleaning product)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT-READ THERMOMETER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Instant-read thermometer is a type of cooking tool)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SAMUEL<|>PERSON<|>Samuel is a person's"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
