Add tomatoes, lemongrass, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat and cook at a bare simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes fall apart and form a chunky sauce, about 20 minutes.\nForce sauce through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on and then discarding solids. Season with salt and pepper.\nPrepare grill for cooking. If using a charcoal grill, open vents on bottom of grill, then light charcoal. Charcoal fire is medium-hot when you can hold your hand 5 inches above rack for 3 to 4 seconds. If using a gas grill, preheat burners on high, covered, 10 minutes, then reduce heat to moderate.\nBrush fish on both sides with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, then season with salt and pepper. Grill fish, covered only if using gas grill, on lightly oiled rack, turning over once, until just cooked through, 7 to 8 minutes total. Serve fish with sauce.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instruct", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 512, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_64b42abc0db3e1ce3d33bfa230f7f98316bc29d4df29f2c57149a93401db095b_v2"}
