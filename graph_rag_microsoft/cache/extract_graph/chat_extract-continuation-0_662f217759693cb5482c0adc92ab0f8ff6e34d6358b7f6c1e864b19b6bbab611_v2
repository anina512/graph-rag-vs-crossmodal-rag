Place the matzo meal in a third bowl. Dust the chicken with the flour, dip into the egg mixture and press into the crumbs to coat.\nPour oil into a large frying pan to a depth of 1\" and heat over medium heat. Cook the chicken in batches, turning, for 2 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Place the tomatoes in a bowl and lightly crush with a fork. Add the vincotto, chile, lemon zest, salt and pepper and mix to combine. Place the chicken in a roasting pan and top with the tomato mixture and mozzarella. Roast for 10–12 minutes or until the cheese is melted and golden.
