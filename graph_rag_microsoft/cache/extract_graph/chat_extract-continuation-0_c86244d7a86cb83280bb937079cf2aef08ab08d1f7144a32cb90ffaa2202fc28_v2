Line heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper. Press brown sugar and cocoa powder through sieve into small bowl to remove any lumps; whisk to blend. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, coarse salt, and cream of tartar in medium bowl until very soft peaks begin to form. With mixer running, gradually add sugar, then espresso powder; beat until medium peaks form. Beat in brown sugar mixture by tablespoonfuls. Continue beating until meringue is very stiff and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold in chopped pecans and chocolate chips, if desired. Drop mixture by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheet, spacing about 1 inch apart. Place 1 pecan half atop each meringue, pressing very lightly to adhere.\nBake meringues until dry but still slightly soft when pressed with finger, about 25 minutes. Turn off oven. Cool meringues in oven with door closed until crisp, about 1 1/2 hours. DO AHEAD: Meringues can be made up to 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PECAN-MOCHA MERINGUES<|>EVENT<|>Pecan-Mocha Meringues is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PECAN-MOCHA MERINGUES<|>EVENT<|>Pecan-Mocha Meringues is a recipe for a dessert)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLDEN BROWN SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Golden brown sugar is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNsweetened COCOA POWDER<|>EVENT<|>Unsweetened cocoa powder is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EGG WHITES<|>EVENT<|>Egg whites are an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COARSE KOSHER SALT<|>EVENT<|>Coarse kosher salt is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREAM OF TARTAR<|>EVENT<|>Cream of tartar is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUGAR<|>EVENT<|>Sugar is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTANT ESPRESSO POWDER<|>EVENT<|>Instant espresso powder is an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINELY CHOPPED TOASTED PECANS<|>EVENT<|>Finely chopped toasted pecans are an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEMISWEET OR BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS<|>EVENT<|>Semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips are an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNTOASTED PECAN HALVES<|>EVENT<|>Untoasted pecan halves are an ingredient in Pecan-Mocha Meringues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVEN<|>GEO<|>Oven is a location where Pecan-Mocha Meringues are baked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVY LARGE BAKING SHEET<|>GEO<|>Heavy large baking"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
